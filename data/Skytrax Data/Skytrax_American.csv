American Airlines,1,S Vanton,28th September 2018,✅ Trip Verified | Please invest a little extra money to fly any other airline. If you have an issue you already paid your money they dont give two cents. I really try not to bash any companies because they employ people. But this company sucks big time.

American Airlines,1,C Parkin,28th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Wichita to Dallas Ft Worth. Lost $6698.00 in flights and then had to spend another $2200.00 to get to our destination! Our flight was delayed four times which caused us to miss our 2nd flight, which was going from Dallas to Iceland (KEF). We had splurged and paid for business class to it was $6698.00 that we lost. Then we bought new tickets from American Airlines and that was another $2200.00. American Airlines will not help with any of our extra travel costs and it was their fault we had to buy more tickets. Not only was our first flight delayed four times, but the flight for the additional tickets we bought for Iceland was delayed over four hours and four separate delays. American Airlines stinks! I won't fly with them again and discourage anyone else from using their airline. I know multiple people who have had terrible experiences with American. They are always late and DFW is too big of an airport to quickly get around if your flight is delayed.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Wichita to Dallas Ft Worth,August 2018,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,C Siddons,27th September 2018,✅ Trip Verified | Washington to Chicago. First my flight was changed without even consenting with me. Then after getting my flights changed I sat in my first connecting flight for a half hour waiting for maintenance to repair the plane forcing me to miss my second connecting flight. Terrible lack of communication. Terrible customer service. Never ever flying with them again. And if you value your time and money I recommend you do the same and fly a different airline.

American Airlines,1,Katie Rambo,27th September 2018,"Not Verified | Vancouver to Phoenix. My flight from YVR was departing at 8:20am Sunday September 23. Upon arrival to the airport at 6am I see the big screen of departures and arrivals, with delayed 1PM next to Phoenix. I first thought well this sucks. My second thought was i have a ton of time to sit here. My third thought was why was I not notified of this delay? Fourth thought, why is the plane delayed so long? Fifth thought, would if this plane never takes off. I find myself over to the American counter, a huge line of people who also we not notified of the delay stand waiting for the attendant to hopefully find a new route for them home. People in line said their flight had been canceled over 24 hours and they had to stay in a motel and received a food voucher, other people said their plane on the way in had been delayed over 13 hours and their whole trip was ruined because they missed out on precious time. I started panicking I did not want to be stuck in Canada all day and night. I was running out of clean clothes and second I didn’t want to have to eat out another meal. I asked the attendant she said I had to wait to speak with someone as it was her second day and she had no idea why the plane had been delayed. Some customer service they have. I had a better idea to call. Once patched through to a human being and not an automated message the lady told me the estimated time was to depart at 1pm. I told her there is no guarantee it’ll take off and by the sounds of it it probably won’t because no one ever even reached out to say it was delayed. The lady said I had to wait until 1PM. I told her absolutely not. I want a refund which I think I got maybe 75% back of the ticket going back. But what a horrible way to end a trip. It is so foreign to me that as a consumer we have to notify the airlines of a cancellation within 24 hours of purchase of our ticket for a full refund. If anytime after that we don’t get a full refund. But the airlines can screw over so many people and ruin so many trips with out notice of delaying or canceling the plane. I will never ever fly American Airlines again. I only flew them this time because Southwest didn’t fly to Canada. I always fly Southwest and never have any issues with them. American Airlines are snakes and fraudulent. They will do anything to keep themselves ahead and don’t care at all about the passengers. I hope others will write about this awful experience from flying from YVR to PHX. American Airlines needs to treat their consumers better or they will tank. They have the worst cancellation policies and attendants working the counters at the airports. So incredibly unhelpful.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Phoenix,September 2018,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,Nicole Tenreiro,26th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to Charlotte via Portland. I was scheduled to depart on 9/15/2018 from Melbourne Fl to Charlotte, NC then leaving from Charlotte, Nc to Portland Me. Unfortunately due to the tropical storm the flight was cancelled. I proceeded to call there 800 number as they instructed to find other arrangements. The agent sent me to Daytona Beach which is an hour and 30 mins away from Melbourne. I drove to the airport only to find out that the agent had booked me on a flight out of Dayton OH. Due to her lack of incompetence, I had driven to an airport that wasn't even flying to my destination. How do you make that mistake knowing I live in Fl and booked me a flight from OH. I called the 800 number again as Delta had a flight leaving from Daytona Beach to Atlanta and they could get me as close as Boston which my destination was Portland ME. Delta suggested that I contact AA and have them transfer my ticket to them. When I got a live agent on the phone they unfortunately could not do that for me as they were not transfering any flights for customers to other airlines. I had to end up paying for another ticket through Delta because of AA incompetents. I am thoroughly disappointed and dissatisfied with how AA handled the situation. They only refunded me for the cancelled flight I originally bought from them and would not refund me for the inconvenience they caused me nor would they give me miles for there agents mistake. They told me that they are not responsible for me making the option of flying and buying another ticket through another airline. That they can only address to higher management about the agent that made the error. I will never fly with AA again. Delta will be my number 1 choice of airline as they went out of there way to make sure that I was able to get to my destination since I was in an airport that AA had me drive to where no flights were going out of that day.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Charlotte via Portland,September 2018,1,1,,,1,3,no

A 7 hour flight for the amount of money I paid should be way more comfortable then this very full flight with no room to move your arms and legs. Everybody is jam packed on this flight.

American Airlines,1,C Sarmina,25th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | La Guardia to Cozumel via Miami. Where do I begin on what turned into the worst 'first class' experience I have ever had! The first flight we were meet with the least impressive first-class seat, which belonged in a premium economy cabin somewhere. I must have missed the memo that American was now selling budget fist class. On this flight the toilet leaked blue goo all over the floor and ruined my partner's shoe when he was the first to discover this. The flight attendants were blasé and showed no empathy or compassion for the situation. Our second flight on the itinerary into Cozumel was thank goodness the one uneventful leg of the journey. Fast forward through a few days in Cozumel to our return flight 1256. You allowed us to leave Cozumel without begin able to land in DFW. Flight cancellation after cancellation lead to us being left on the tarmac in San Antonio for hours. We were then taken off the plane to clear customs and abandoned in San Antonio. No communication attempts were made except emails saying I had been rescheduled on flights, moved to a lower class of service and then those were cancelled as well. I was willing to take my chances that Houston would be a better bet given weather and we had to rent a car to get us to Houston to attempt to get home to SFO in a reasonable amount of time. I am unsure why we left Cozumel when you could not get us to the destination city. I find it irresponsible to have taken all of these passengers when the pilot told us from the get go we would need to circle around Dallas- ie we couldn’t land there. As a result of this experience, I am cancelling my upcoming reservation as the cancellation penalty could not be as painful as another flight with American Airlines. Last but not least their app is terrible and the wifi is not supported on most planes to provide entertainment",,Couple Leisure,First Class,La Guardia to Cozumel via Miami,September 2018,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,2,C Reave,24th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | On our American Airlines flight from MSO to DFW, we were diverted to LBB (Lubbock, TX) due to weather. It happens, airlines cannot control the weather. It's what happens after they can control! We were in a holding pattern waiting for the weather to get better; however, it did not. The crew, obviously, notified their dispatch as when we landed in LBB they left to the hotel. There had to be communication there so American knew we were coming to LBB. After landing, the crew let us know they had ""timed out"", meaning they could not fly anymore (FAA regs.). The pilot said, ""We will probably be back around 5:00 AM tomorrow."" Good communication so far. Then we were de-planed. We were told by the flight crew to proceed to the AA counter for options. Many people stood at the counter for several hours; no one showed up. A police officer for the airport, who was extremely helpful, tried multiple times to get someone from AA to respond; to no avail. We had to leave to go to a hotel as we had been traveling with little sleep, unfortunately, we did not have our luggage. AA would not remove the bags from the airplane. Multiple phone calls were made to AA's 800 number. Not one representative cared enough to even try to assist. We were only told to take it up with the local AA counter. Here we were at another airport, no baggage, and nobody to speak with. The AA android app, which is HORRIBLE, showed a new flight for us three days later. If we were told go to a hotel, get some sleep, and return tomorrow for the flight to connect to DFW, we would have been good. Instead nothing! We ended up at the hotel at 1:30 AM, then returned to the airport at 5:00 AM, as the Captain lead us to believe the flight would leave around 5:00 AM. Well, it did not! The flight ended up leaving around 10:30 AM. We had to book another flight on Delta, which was excellent BTW, to get to our final destination. We still have not been able to speak with a representative to get a refund. Needless to say we will not fly American Airlines again.",Embraer E170,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,MSO to DFW,September 2018,3,4,3,4,2,3,no
American Airlines,1,D Hall,24th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Terrible experience on American. Was flying from Peoria to Houston via DFW on Sept 21. Flight was late/rebooked out of Peoria due to bad weather at DFW, then couldn't land at DFW so had to refuel in Wichita and sit there a couple hours, then finally got to DFW at about 12:30a & it was about 1a by the time I had gotten to talk to a gate agent about flights home. Many customers had to sleep in the airport. All hotels were reportedly booked & American made no effort to help us find lodging. I tried several hotels and finally got to one at 2:15am. Left out of DFW the next morning, got to Houston, but my luggage was sent to the wrong airport (IAH instead of Hobby). My destination had been changed the previous day (Houston Hobby, then IAH, then Hobby again due to flight delays, cancellations, etc), but they assured me repeatedly that the bags would be delivered to the correct airport. The AA app showed I had checked 4 bags when I had only checked two. I called AA and straightened it all out but when my luggage wasn't delivered to my home I had to call again and they said they had no record of the prior call and that they might not be able to get luggage delivered to me until next day. I finally gave up and drove 20 miles to IAH myself to get the bags. Worst treatment I've ever experienced on an airline. The weather isn't their fault but dumping us off at DFW after midnight w/ no assistance to find lodging, and the incompetence without my bags, is inexcusable.",,Business,Economy Class,Peoria to Houston via DFW,September 2018,1,2,1,,1,1,no

American Airlines,1,B Danson,23rd September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I would never recommend American Airlines to anyone. I was originally suppose to be on a flight from Las Vegas, with a stop over in LAX with Honolulu as destination. Our flight kept getting delayed (which I understand can happen) I waited in line to speak to ladies at desk for at least 40 minutes, then only to be told to sit back down as my following flight won’t be affected. Then the flight got further delayed. So I went back in the line for at least another 45 minutes to check what I should do. I totally understand that the woman on counter was having a stressful time but honestly the customer service skills are disgusting. I have never heard people being so rude in the way they spoke to customers on that counter. When I finally got to the front of the line we were put on another flight with Hawaiian Airlines. The flight was to leave 10 hours after our original flight was meant to leave. I was reassured that our luggage would be put on that flight. After waiting around the airport for all this time and discovering that most of the food places were shut we ended up getting a taxi to take us to get some food. When we finally got on our flight and arrived in Honolulu, we then discovered our luggage wasn’t transferred onto Hawaiian airlines and was still sitting in L.A. Now I am normally a very patient person, the 10 hour wait I could handle, but the luggage not arriving after all that waiting around is what’s really annoyed me. We are actually on our honey moon and this was a short stop for a few days in Honolulu, before our return to Australia. So I would hope that American Airlines can get their sh*t together and get our bags to us today! By the way Hawaiin airlines are amazing to travel with and their staff are much more happier and willing to help, customers are their main concern.

That was fine I mean things do happen. When we got to Dallas I called customer service to say I wanted to switch the flight and just go home because my flight was delayed and I was annoyed at this point. I spoke with the manager on duty of customer service and they assured me that I would not have to worry about another delay the captain gave the okay to fly out. The delayed flight was suppose to leave at 9:40 then 10:30 comes around and I’m calling to switch planes and I get placed on hold for another hour and thirteen minutes, in the time I’m on hold my flight gets canceled and the customer service rep basically says they can not do anything for me because it was now technically a rain delay.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Cancun,September 2018,3,1,3,,1,1,no
American Airlines,3,H Garner,22nd September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Boston to Phoenix. Purchased first class but on return trip was re-booked for the following day in coach seats after 9 hours of delay and 2 times boarding and deplaning! The staff appeared to be uninformed by management about the true nature of the delays as the excuse given kept changing between maintenance issues and staffing problems. Nine hours in the airport with nothing more than water and chips or granola bars after the first deplaning. All the food service in the airport was closed by this time because it was late.The airline only refunded a fraction of what I have calculated to be fair (the difference between the first class seat purchased and the coach seat assigned). American booked passengers in hotels nearby but the dinner vouchers were worthless since it was 10:30 pm by the time we were re-ticketed and left the airport. I filed my first partial refund request through American Airlines website on August 21st--a month ago. The employee who initially responded has now ceased to follow up and no on else from Customer Relations has contacted me. Called the ""Refunds"" department and was told she can't help me. After I insisted on a phone number for ""Customer Relations"" she gave me a toll free number that was no longer working! Hard to believe that wasn't intentional. Why does this need to be under review so long before a determination is made? I was told it would take 2 full business days. Why do they make it impossible for customers to talk with someone?

American Airlines,1,Jordan Cart,22nd September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Milwaukee to Dallas. So I booked my flight months in advance to go visit my friend in Dallas. The flight was delayed. At first by thirty mins, then an hour, then two and a half hours. They said they couldn’t find the crew, or get hold of them. Ok seems weird but I’m sure it happens. Then, they cancel it all of a sudden because of the weather. Alright, that’s reasonable. I’d rather not die. So I wasn’t really losses off at this point. I figured these things happen and my time isn’t really any more valuable than everyone else’s so whatever I’ll deal with it. So I go to the bathroom and grab a snack, figuring I’ll wait for the line to die down before talking to the booking agents. Well big mistake. All of the AA agents are gone. No trace. Vanished. It’s honestly only 7:30pm at this point, not like it’s 2am or something. So ok, no big deal, figured I’d just call. Well I’ve been on hold with no answer for over an hour now. Went online to see what I could do, they chose a new flight for me. All of the other flights have one to three layovers. Great. No now I paid a bunch of money to be in Dallas for less than 24 hours. And I tried to file to receive a refund online. surprise! That page conveniently does not work. Honestly I’m not even mad my flight got canceled because that’s just life, but clearly their customer service is terrible.

American Airlines,1,Ariana Burrell,21st September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Phoenix to Joplin via LAX / Dallas. American Airlines is the worst airline I have ever taken. First I try to book a one way ticket to Joplin, Mo but I guess you can’t do that because the airports are small, so they had my flight going to LAX airport and me staying there for 2 an a half hours, which then went to Dallas and me stay there for an hour and a half just to then be in Joplin at 10pm when the flight from Phx was at 6am. I get to the check in place and the lady that is checking my bags tells me she going to change my flight because they is a delay that I didn’t even know of, and she can make where I go to Dallas to then Joplin. So everything is going well until we are 10 mins from Dallas airport and I guess there was a storm and the Pilot didn’t feel like he could landed there so he flies to Love Field airport where at first it was because the weather but then the fuel part broke and had us sitting on the plane for 4 hours. They finally fix it and then we get to Dallas and wait an hour again on the plane because they didn’t have our gate ready. Everyone missed there flight and the workers were very rude. Everyone had to stay all night till the next day. But they booked my flight to Kansas City, Two hours away from Joplin, Mo. So I had to buy a rental car, thank god I had my credit card because they weren’t going to give me one, and I drive two hour to Joplin. But that’s not it they tell me my bag had to go to Joplin so to pick it up there so when I got there no bag. I then had to go out and buy clothes till a lady drive my bag to me from Kansas City!

American Airlines,1,Caleb Walker,20th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Charlotte to Anchorage via Seattle. As many people know, American had some serious software blackout issues that delayed and cancelled an untold number of flights on June 17 - the day I happened to be flying. I had saved my airline miles to take a once-in-a-lifetime trip with my two young daughters. I spent 240,000 airline miles, only to have my flights delayed (and later found out they were cancelled). We had guided tours booked in Anchorage, and delays meant cancelled trip, lost money, no memories. We had been planning this trip for the last two years, so out of desperation, I stayed on the phone with American until I was able to book a flight out of Charlotte, a two hour drive away. We threw the luggage in the car and rushed to make it in time. We eventually made our final destination, but not with our luggage - it was lost. Without going into too many details, it was late at night the following day before I got my luggage, and only because I physically went back to the airport, demanded to look in their baggage claim, then demanded to do a physical search of the Alaskan Airlines baggage area. No one could find my bag in their computer, but I found it stuffed in the back of Alaska Airlines. If I had not taken all of these extreme measures our trip would be a total loss. The flight itself was ok. No food offered without extra fees. The flight attendants only came by once. The seats were very tight and uncomfortable. When I returned I filed a complaint with American, asking for at least some of my miles to be refunded. They offered a whopping 682 miles for my trouble. 682 miles out of 240,000!! I was appalled. I literally could not believe such a slap in the face. I appealed my complaint to corporate, and received a scripted answer letting me know that they stood by their decision and reassured me it was more than fair. Of course, they wanted to make sure I knew how much they hoped I would give them a second chance. Hmm, a second chance to do what exactly? After my time, my expense, my stress, my fight to drive to a far away airport, to go back to physically search and find my luggage that wasn't even tracked in their computer (it still said it was in Seattle waiting for another flight). I can't even book a flight from Greenville to Charlotte for less than 15,000 miles per person on their own website. We had three people, but they think 682 miles refunded was fair compensation. Shame on them. We have very different opinions regarding what is fair. I have been a loyal customer of American up until now.

American Airlines,1,C Burton,20th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | American Airlines from Honolulu to Minneapolis via Dallas. The flight in Dallas (7:30 am) was delayed due to technical problems by 20 mins (7:50 am), which quickly escalated to change in fight and gate. Also the departure time was delayed by another 30 mins (8:25 am). Everyone was visibly tired at this point, but we still made it. The departure was again delayed by another 20 mins (8:50 am) because, “the new flight needs cleaning”. The time shows 8:45 am and no sign of boarding. When asked, the reason was that, “some of the life vests are out of the packets, they are working on fixing that, that’s why there is a delay in boarding”. The reason I am writing this review is that this is not the first time this has happened with American Airlines. A similar delay of 4.5 hours happened on the same trip (from Phoenix this time to Honolulu). The flight was scheduled at 2 pm. We boarded the flight and was asked to disembark due to technical issues. Again the flight and gate was changed and we boarded after 4.5 hours at 6:30 pm.

American Airlines,1,Gideon Ansell,20th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I was traveling with colleagues from Boston to NE Arkansas, via O'Hare. We were supposed to have a 1.5 hour layover. Our flight from Boston to Chicago was delayed by an hour due to weather. No problem, these things happen. Usually when flights are delayed by that much the airline makes a special attempt to help travelers who need to make connections. But as we approached landing in Chicago they made no mention of connecting flights. They did not ask if anyone needed to rush off the plane to make a flight. They did not announce whether there were gate changes for connecting flights. I was at the back of the plane. Others I were traveling with were further up front. They ran ahead to the gate, which was in another wing of the terminal, a 10 minute walk, 6 minute run. I followed as soon as I got off the plane. Of course the gate was changed but no one at the old gate, when I finally got there, knew where the new gate was, so that took 3 minutes to locate it. My traveling companions who got to the correct gate first told the gate attendants that I was right behind them. But still they closed the jetway door seconds before I arrived and refused to open it. They had nothing to say, just pointed me to the customer service desk. The flights themselves were fine, comfortable, but the lack of customer focus, common courtesy, and most importantly the lack of helpful service on the delayed flight is emblematic of a company that just doesn't care. No attempt was made to help avoid the problem to begin with by asking if anyone had to rush due to the delay. No calls were made to the connecting gate to tell them that passengers were on their way. No attempt was made to help at the gate. And no apology was given at the service desk. It was a full team effort across numerous American employees to demonstrate that they couldn't care less about me as a customer. Pathetic. Also, JetBlue and Virgin both have free Wifi.

American Airlines,7,T Carwen,18th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Seoul to Dallas Fort Worth. Overall, a great experience with AA on a long haul flight, but some minor things could make it a little better. A few days prior to my flight, I attempted to upgrade my seat online. I work in IT so I know what I'm doing. The AA web-page kept asking me to update some details, which I did, but kept coming back and saying that they were not updated. As a result, I was unable to pay and do an upgrade. Tried this five times on different days, same result. Met a couple in Inchon who had exactly the same problem. Please fix your web-page! Despite explaining very slowly, AA staff at Inchon at check in did not upgrade me either, even though the seat was available. Fortunately, just prior to boarding, found a staff member who understood English properly, and she did my upgrade, thanks! The flight was great; fast, quiet, food and drinks were nice, and cabin crew were very polite and kind, but who on earth selected these ultra small seats? Difficult to eat your meal without knocking your neighbor with your elbows. Please, even take out just ONE row would make the whole thing 100% better. Feel sorry for the cabin crew, impossible to get past one of them in the aisle if the food trolleys are in use. Despite all of this, I'm going to give good marks due to the newness of the aircraft, and the professionalism of the cabin crew. Captain had a great sense of humor too.

American Airlines,2,H Wilson,17th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I recently flew American Airlines for the first time on a trip to New York. My negative experience started right from the check in, where (with BA) I am used to dropping my bags, checking in and selecting my seat in less than 5 mins. In contrast, the check-in agents from American took 25 mins in total to override the computer to check my bags, and the same to select seats for my travel companion and myself. Obviously at LHR T3 I opted to use the Qantas, and Cathay First lounges - which are fantastic. Once onboard I started to really notice the difference in service and etiquette from other airlines. As being a top tier flyer and even when flying economy, on other OW carriers I am always greeted personally by a member of the crew, but on American I was completely ignored. Food and drink service was just average, I made the mistake in forgetting to order a special meal. I wouldn't bother trying to ask for another drink after service has finished. I politely waved at an attendant as she passed for the cabin and asked for another drink, and her response was very unenthusiastic. She returned 5 mins later and I thanked her, her response was shark ""OK"" and she disappeared. A seat mate pressed the call button as he needed water, and was scolded by one of the attendant, so for the rest of the flight I was too scared to ask for anything. In summary, the ground crew are grossly incapable and as for the onboard service.

On Monday 27th my daughter and I supposed to fly in Chicago from Atlanta at 7:15am (flight # 1951) and from Chicago having our next flight to London at 9:15 am (flight #1541). I supposed to meet my sister at Heathrow Airport in London so we booked a hotel in London airport for the night of 27th until next morning Tuesday 28th because we had tickets to go in Paris, France. So we checked in just fine in Atlanta we went through security line… no problem we got at the gate in time, we got our seats, boarding passes and then we were waiting to go in a plane to Chicago. Right when they scan our tickets, they told us to get on the side to fix the boarding passes because the “sequence #’s are wrong! And was British Airways mistake (so either way was not our problem). Instead of taking the time to fix our problem the lady and her co-worker they were trying to fix other people problems and didn’t let us go in a plane even that we told them our next bookings and connections we have. They called the manger in charge for that day and she didn’t care to figure out what is going on. She left because she had a emergency problem not “minor problem” like ours so we were left I Atlanta airport. They finally put us on 10:00 pm direct flight from Atlanta (the only one available) So we had to spend all day in airport and miss our hotel night and almost the flight to Paris. We had a check in luggage that travel to Chicago and couldn’t be located so we had to file a claim when we got in Paris.

About halfway there the plane pulls over and the Pilot states “sorry folks, the plane is a little grumpy today, we have another maintenance issue and should be ready in about 20 mins.

As a Oneworld Emerald am entitled to a range of benefits on AA including priority seating for myself and family. My daughter was traveling with me on this occasion, albeit on a paid ticket on separate record. AA flat out refused to link our records so my daughter could sit with me in Main Cabin Extra, necessitating me to downgrade to sit with my daughter. We were guilty of buying two paid tickets on different records and no fewer than six AA phone and airport personnel were unable to resolve and change. Instead MCE seats were given to non status customers for free at JFK check in. I am extremely loyal and fly 50+ AA, 100 Oneworld flights per year and simply cannot understand the lack of empathy or empowerment of employees in situations like this.

As everyone knows, Hurricane Florence is approaching the East Coast. Well, I have a flight schedule to leave on September 14th, the same day Hurricane Florence is set to make landfall. When I received word that I was able to change my flight and the fee will be waived, I called AA customer service line. I explained to the CS rep that I obtained my ticket with my points and I wanted to cancel my ticket and have my miles credited back to my account. She told me that it can be done. She went to explain to me that two things can happen. The first is, I can purchase another ticket with my points but, I have to fly before September 19th. I informed her that wouldn't work because, If I was not able to travel Friday (14th Sep) there was no reason to fly because I was traveling for a specific reason. So the second thing she tells me is, I could get credit for my points after I pay them $150.00 to credit the points back to my account. I told her that was crazy. Why would I pay $150 for something that I earned for paying full price. She also told me I could forfeit my points if I choose to. This entire conversation was so crazy to me. I told her, it wasn't like I was cancelling on my own, there was a pending storm coming. All she could say was she understood. I don't think she does.

After they loaded the airplane parts and we were ready to leave informed us that we need to top off our gas because of the fuel used and taxiing out and having to taxi back to the gate. Then we were delayed again because we had ran out of bottled water on the plane after sitting for several hours.

American Airlines,4,T Gewndall,8th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Tokyo Haneda to Los Angeles. The legroom in economy was appalling and the service mediocre. I'm 198cm tall (6'6""), and usually when I fly other airlines between Japan and the U.S., I can get some extra legroom at no cost --= either by asking for a bulkhead seat or an exit row. American, however, charges extra for these options. (Seriously!? I'm supposed to pay for the privilege of assisting other passengers in the event of an emergency?!) Other (non-U.S.) airlines consider this a matter of customer service. When the ground attendants see me, they usually understand my need. Moreover, the legroom in a normal economy seat on this flight was horrendous. I actually had way more legroom in a regular economy seat on my flight a few days later with Southwest between Los Angeles and Denver. That's right -- a low-cost carrier offered considerably more legroom on a 2.5-hour flight on a Boeing 737 than American did on a 10-hour flight on a Boeing 787. On top of this, I didn't see any of the flight attendants smile during the whole flight. They weren't actively unfriendly, but they barely even acknowledged passengers with eye contact. I tried to be a model passenger and say ""please"" and ""thank you"" when ordering and receiving drinks and food, but crew members didn't even acknowledge this with a ""You're welcome"" or a smile. Also, the food was decidedly substandard. A few things were good about the flight: The tickets were cheap, the flight was on time, and the entertainment system and options were good. Also, on my return flight the staff were a bit more friendly. These are the reasons I'm rating it a 4. This is why I always try to avoid US. carriers.

American Airlines,1,Roy Whitehead,7th September 2018,"Not Verified | The worst experience ever! I booked tickets in March 2018 for a trip from Phoenix to DCA in June 2018. We were assigned seats in row 16 on the outbound flight and row 17 on the return flight. I happened to call the airline one week before the flight to ask a question about baggage fees. I was told that the seats had been changed and we were in row 33 on the outbound flight and row 32 on the return flight. The representative was of no help. I was also told that we had been assigned a new flight that was leaving and returning at a different time than the original flight. We were never told of the flight or seat changes and had I called in to ask about the baggage fees we would not have known until we checked in. After several calls I was told that I could “upgrade” my current seats to essentially the same seats I had originally booked for $300 extra. I paid the extra fees because I did not want to sit in the back of the plane. After several more phone calls I was told that they would look into giving me a credit for extra $300. They finally did give me credit for the additional $300 that I paid. That’s all they did. No apology. Nothing. This airline does not care about customer experience. In contrast, my wife and I had a Southwest flight that was just delayed two hours in leaving phoenix to San Francisco. Southwest gave us each a voucher for $100 for the inconvenience. It is hard to believe that an airline such as American does not value it’s customers. Here is the email that they sent regarding our experience… “Thank you for contacting American Airlines on behalf of XXX and XXXX XXXXXXXXX. I'm sorry the advanced seat assignments our mutual clients were given were not the seats they were scheduled to receive at the time of their departure after their flight experienced a schedule change/equipment change. I understand their frustration, as seating arrangements are important to our customers. Because there are several possibilities for why a passenger can lose their pre-requested seat assignment, such as a change in aircraft, a special needs customer, a child traveling alone etc., we cannot guarantee specific seats will be available on day of departure.

American Airlines,8,W Neale,6th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Sydney via Charlotte / Los Angeles. Unremarkable or even bad service is frankly the norm on pretty much every airline in the US, with certain well-known exceptions. To expect anything else is setting yourself up for disappointment, as reflected by the majority of reviews for this airline. Yes, I too have experienced the dreaded day-long weather delay, but I still fly American because they handled the situation as well as could be expected and they don't control the weather. I flew from New York to Sydney with layovers in Charlotte and Los Angeles. My domestic short-haul flights were unremarkable. I had a tight connection in Charlotte (40 minutes) which I made with no problem thanks to helpful ground staff. Both flights were on older 737s without seatback or BYOD IFE. On the flight from JFK to CLT this was fine, but the 5 hour flight from CLT to LAX would have been unpleasant had I not had my own stuff on hand. Legroom on both flights was more than adequate. I am 6 feet tall, somewhat overweight, and had no issues with personal space. American's hard product is easily my personal favorite of the big three, even on older aircraft. Beverage service was brusque and impersonal, as is the norm, but flight attendants were very good in a one-on-one setting. There were frequent advertisements for AA-branded credit cards on both flights, taking the form of promotional videos and several in-flight announcements from flight attendants. Some announcements alluded to cardholder benefits not actually provided by the card, so be wary of that should you find the offer enticing, but I believe this was more a misunderstanding of the product by the FAs than a willful attempt to deceive. All in all, American's domestic service is perfectly reasonable, provided you have realistic expectations of what an airline is and isn't capable of doing. American's long haul international service greatly exceeded my admittedly minimal expectations. My flight from LAX to Sydney, clocking in at a whopping 15 hours, was a brand new 787-900 with a 3-3-3 layout in economy, a definite improvement over the 3-4-3 layout found on most American long haul metal. The seat provided ample legroom and storage space. Carry-on bins were large and easily accessible. IFE was provided by a large, high definition seatback screen. The selection was enormous, but leaned much more heavily to films over TV. The in-flight map is better than most US carriers. The interface for the IFE is somewhat frustrating at first. The default layout requires frequent swiping and dragging, which the touch screen is not very good at. This can be fixed by switching to a grid based display system, which I did not discover was an option until we were close to landing. There was also a catalogue of music and books available though the system, but the selection was not very good. Dinner and breakfast were served to all passengers on this flight. Meals were surprisingly good, being flavorful and well-portioned in both instances. I enjoyed about 7 hours of rest on this flight, which is much better than the 2 or 3 I generally manage to hobble together flying to Europe. The 787 is a wonderful aircraft, and is easily my first choice when flying overseas. All in all, my round trip flight from New York to Sydney cost $1400 per person, an excellent value. I would fly American again, both domestically and internationally.",Boeing 737-700 / 787-9,Business,Economy Class,New York to Sydney via Charlotte / LAX,February 2018,4,4,3,4,5,5,yes
American Airlines,1,S Gealey,5th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Phoenix to Atlanta. Worst service ever! I flew with my 2 year old daughter and we both were given an aisle seat. I asked the rep if any other seats were available so I could sit with my child. She rolled her eyes. I'm guessing because I interrupted the personal conversation she was having with the other rep, I know it was personal because they each made no attempt at concealing this detail. She then asked for my boarding pass and continued her conversation with the other employee. She printed my new boarding passes and placed them on the desk in front of me. All without stopping her conversation or looking me in the eye. After the flight, I get home and my laptop will not power on.

American Airlines,1,P Steenson,5th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Chicago to Knoxville. Returning home from a trip overseas is never easy, fortunately there’s American Airlines to help. Not only will they cancel your flight, they won’t give you any sort of compensation for a hotel reservation. Additionally, American Airlines won’t make any efforts to make sure you’re on the next available flight to your home town. If you like apathetic, lazy customer experience, then you’ll love American Airlines. As an American, I feel embarrassed that these clowns supposedly represent the US. Within the past few weeks I’ve flown Delta, Norwegian, as well as EasyJet. Several of these have been long, international flights over eight hours long. My American Airlines flight was domestic, and barely two hours long. Leave it to American Airlines to be the painful conclusion to your otherwise pleasant travels. I’m going to give them one star though, as my plane didn’t crash. American Airlines has managed to disappoint in almost every other aspect.

However, what we received from AA instead were red-eye flights, cancelled flights without explanation, and unanticipated expenditures associated with AA’s treatment of the 3 of us. And then AA had the audacity to offer us $100 in a voucher for a future flight on AA. By our calculations, AA made a lot more than $100 off each of us by cancelling flights that weren’t full, traveling during non-peak travel times-with AA pocketing the profits-forcing us to pay for hotels and transportation fees out-of-pocket, holding us hostage in airports with ever changing departure times, where we had no other option, but to eat airport food at premium prices, without the courtesy of respecting the sales contract by flying us out at your scheduled departure and arrival times.",,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Chicago to San Jose via Dallas-Fort Worth,July 2018,1,2,3,2,1,1,no

I have been flying on low cost airlines that are much better than American Airlines. My flight was supposed to take off from Baltimore at 2pm, but was cancelled after 3 hours of waiting, because they didn't manage to fix an A/C problem in the cockpit! They put me on a flight departing 6 hours later from Washington. They wouldn't provide a refund, they wouldn't provide a lounge pass or a voucher to get something to eat, the sit they gave me was worse than the previous one and (cherry on the cake) they forced me to check in my carry-on, so I had to board holding all the valuables, batteries, computer, etc. in my hands. As it wasn't bad enough already, all the above was communicated with the rudest possible manners one could use. Thanks - I am paying for this, in case you didn't know.

On our approach to Charlotte for my layover I realized we were circling the area? The pilot eventually lets us know we’re in a holding pattern because of weather issues and that if it persist we would have to fly to another airport to refuel. We did, we had to refuel in Tri City Tennessee. By this time I’ve missed my connecting flight to Melbourne! Once we landed in Charlotte I exited the plane to find the entire airport in complete chaos! I check in at the ticket desk to find out what flight I now need to catch to finally get to my destination, Melbourne Fl. At this point the ticket agent let me know, there were no more flights to Melbourne! “Go to customer service” I did, once there the customer service agent was rude, incompetent to the point another agent had to help navigate the computer system! End result, I had a choice, stay the night in Charlotte at a hotel on my dime, “because it isn’t American Airlines fault, there was weather issues” so no they will not put you up in a hotel and catch the flight in the morning to Melbourne OR catch a flight to Orlando International. I did, I’m now out an additional $150 for a hotel and I’ve had to have my wife come and pick me up in Orlando and drive me back to Melbourne to pick up my vehicle.

There wasn’t anyone there to let people know or a notice put up, nothing. We were then told that the new gate flight had already left, they changed it during the 2 hours we were in the air in our first flight. We complained and they insisted it was our own fault because they said they never print gate numbers on their tickets, when I showed them my ticket with a gate number on it that they had given me 3 hours previous they said it was still our fault for not looking at the monitors. They also said we should have known when no one was waiting, but lobby was full of people waiting. I went to speak to manager and she rebooked my party of 5 on the next flight 8 hours later so we waited and we had a non refundable tour booked in New Orleans that we were now missing.

When I got to DFW airport, my connecting flight was already left, and the next flight was in 12 hours (that is, the next morning). After realizing this, I decided to talk to AA Customer Service at DFW airport, and ask them for a place to spend the night. However, they told me your flight is not eligible for such an offer. So, they made me to stay at airport for 12 hours, without any accommodation. They technically treated me like a baggage. The day after this experience, I decided to contact AA to fill a complain and ask them for refund or something.

After main course the crew dimmed the lights and we had to close our window shades. Shortly before landing the crew served either a Vanilla - or a spinach wrap with drinks. My layover in PHL was tiring but ok. At the gate there was no agent for a long time even at boarding time. So we had about 20-30 minutes delay, which was ok but I didnt´t knew the reason.

We immediately went to speak to an American Airlines representative, who told us that they were likely not going to be able to get us into Kansas City that evening. What they could do is get us into Phoenix, to which they could put us up in a hotel for the night, and we could fly out the next day (the 13th). Seeing this was only realistic option we had we agreed to stay in Phoenix for the night. As we waited on the flight to arrive from its delay, once we got on the plane, the flight was then again delayed, this time due to weather in Phoenix. After about 20 minutes the flight was then cancelled. We got in line to talk with another American Airlines representative to see what we would need to do for a hotel reservation to stay in Sacramento for the night, as we clearly were not getting into Phoenix. We were then told that they were not responsible for hotel accommodations due to inclement weather. Had we known that the flight to Phoenix was going to have weather trouble we would have taken the flight into Charlotte, or we could have looked at another Airline flight. I asked if I could speak to a manager and the representative told me I would need to go online to file a complaint.. The Customer Service Representative wouldn't even sit us together on our flights for the next day. We were assigned separated seats and when we asked if we could sit together, we were told that we would have to pay a premium for upgraded seats (There were multiple open seats at that time, many of which were not first class). All and all we spent about 7 hours in the airport that day We both ended up having to take an additional day of work We had to pay someone to watch our animals for an additional day We had to pay for a hotel in Sacramento We had to pay for dinner, breakfast, and lunch before we got to fly out the next day (8/13) We had to pay for transportation to the hotel from the airport And we had to pay for an additional day of parking in Kansas City On top of all of this. I have had to call and plead my case (three separate calls) to American Airlines ""Customer Service"" for over two hours on the phone. I have spoken to three different “Customer Service Reps” and 2 different managers. After a week of not hearing from American Airlines I decided to call back. This time I was told that they could not find the complaint that had been filed by Lou and that if I had a formal complaint I would need to file it with the online form (https://www.aa.com/contact/forms?topic=CR#/). This whole ordeal has cost me an insurmountable amount of time and stress at my job to take care of, almost 3 hours I have been on the phone.

American Airlines,1,Lacey Jones,23rd August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Dallas Ft Worth. My flight with another airline was cancelled last minute due to weather; so, I booked a one-way ticket with AA for the following day using the miles I had been saving for years and paid the $75 fee to do so. After waiting on the runway for almost 3 hours, we were told we had to return to the gate to refuel; however, once at the gate, we were finally told that the flight was cancelled and passengers were told to deplane and figure it out with the gate agent. The next flight AA could get me on was the following day at 6pm, so I waited in line for 3 more hours to obtain a travel voucher for one night stay (would you want your wife or daughter sleeping alone in LaGuardia Airport?) But to my surprise, I was told by the AA gate agent, who was seemingly extremely exhausted and overwhelmed, that AA no longer issued travel vouchers and that would have to instead submit a post-flight reimbursement claim at AA.com/customerrelations, including all receipts for hotel, food and transportation. As you can already guess, my request was denied, stating that it is not AA's 'approach to offer compensation for ATC delays', plus a bunch of other highly-pacifist lip service. My frustration and reason for this review is not due to my time being wasted on a runway for 3 hours or even for the flight being cancelled. My frustration is due to the fact that an AA employee lied directly to my face about AA no longer issuing travel vouchers (since apparently they do still offer voucher for cancelled flights) knowing damn-well I would not be reimbursed. So, on top of the miles and fee I paid to use those miles that I'd already spent thousands of dollars on to obtain, I'm out an additional $470 bc their employee lied to me.

However, once on the line with this agent, my complaint changed from one of unfortunate circumstance to one of complete disbelief that American Airlines can be so callous towards customers. The supervisor was condescending, patronizing, and insulting from the very opening of the call. She pronounced my name with blatant disgust and ensured to pronounce hers with an air of authority that indicated I should feel graced by the fact that she took a few minutes out of her important schedule to speak to me. She belittled my concerns, refused to offer any recourse whatsoever, or apologies for inconveniences, and basically openly insulted me when I implied that the airline with the flight I was trying to get on was American Airlines, as opposed to being an opposing airlines flight. When I called her out on this by asking her if she found it acceptable to speak to me with a condescending and patronizing tone of voice was to talk over me, loudly telling me that she was not doing that, and then to proceed to disconnect my phone call in the middle of my sentence. I called back, and requested to speak to a supervisor in regards to my experience with a customer service rep. She patched me through to a representative in the same position, that informed me that she doesn't know who she is, and I can't file a complaint through her or speak to anyone who can record a complaint against her, as they are an email only department. After about 15 minutes of going around in circles with her, I wrote out a detailed email to the department I was told to reach out to, and received a cookie cutter type response offering insincere apologies and offering no recourse whatsoever. The agent and my experience with American Airlines has left me in complete disbelief that a company can operate with such indecent practices, and offer no remorse whatsoever or even a token apology to make the situation a little more bearable. I understand that some things, especially weather, are out of a companies control, but the callous disregard they have for the inconvenience that their customers are put through as well as the disrespectful way that their customer service handles the situation are completely unacceptable. There is a lot more to the story that I am unable to add due to the character limit, but I hope that my poor experience will serve to warn people away from this horrible company.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Bozeman,August 2018,2,2,1,1,1,1,no

American Airlines,1,Kelsie Penny,20th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I paid for a normal flight to Memphis from Pittsburg which has a layover in Philadelphia. This flight allows you to bring one bag that fits under your seat as long as it’s the appropriate size which I think is 18”x14”x8” which my bag was 14”x14”x8”. They wouldn’t allow overhead access which is a new rule but it can go under your seat. I applied by this rule. As I’m boarding the plane they told me I had to check my bag and couldn’t board with it. This is absolutely bogus. I had to complain to them to let me bring my bag on. They told me there wasn’t anymore overhead bin room. Great, I get that, but mine fits under the seat as I premeasured my bag. They said they didn’t care, they didn’t have overhead bin access so I had to check my bag. I told them I understand that there isn’t but mine fits under my seat. They then tried to say that it didn’t matter because I had two bags, the second being my purse... since when do purses count? But that could also fit in my bag so i put my purse in my bag. They eventually let me take my bag (which comfortably fit under my seat) but I had to complain to them more than enough times.

I understand that it’s they deal with a lot of angry people but this time I really needed to make my flight for a work obligation. I received little to no help at the desk & was told to call the 800 number. I am so glad I did! I spoke with Deborah (we had the same name) she went above and beyond any flight line agent I’ve ever had (and I fly frequently) I am beyond impressed! She did not have to try to help me as much as she did and calm me in a stressful situation (on the verge of an anxiety attack to calmly writing this review on the plane). She stayed on the phone working a ton of logistics for almost an hour, she stayed on the phone until I was able to confirm I was good to go for my next two flights! She was so kind and helpful.

American Airlines,1,Celeste Dunican,18th August 2018,"Not Verified | Reno to Dallas. Do not fly American Airlines. As a young first time traveler I was unaware of how poor customer service would be. We came from Reno trying to get home to Hartford which requires a connecting fight in Dallas Fort Worth. My younger sister and I got to our first gate no problem where they spent 20 minutes begging people to check luggage causing the line to back up. The plane took off late. We thought it wasn’t a huge deal because we had time between flights. Both flights were booked through American which I thought would make them a little more aware of delays with other planes. Myself and 6 other very kind people missed our connecting flight to Hartford all on the same plane. We landed and sat on the ground for 25-30 minutes “waiting for a gate and crew.” They closed our flight because we got off the plane too late by no fault of our own. They then sent us to customer service where we waited in line for about 40 minutes for them to tell us the only other flight to Hartford was at 7:30 am the next morning where we again would have to get on a connecting flight in Chicago. The people were terribly rude at the desk where they then told us it wasn’t their fault and we would have to cover all our room costs to stay the night in Dallas. Flights are not cheap making this service completely inexcusable. It would be a whole different thing if this was an inexpensive product. My sister and I ended up pooling all our traveling money together to spend $90 to stay in a room over night. I wish I could give them zero stars. To be fair our flight there was not something to complain about, but they have lost my business forever. Not to mention all the other people on my same flight who missed their connecting flights. With this first hand experience I would never recommend American Airlines to anyone who would prefer to not be treated like a piece of luggage themselves.

American Airlines,1,Riyad Naser,18th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Kansas to Barcelona via Chicago. I had been traveling since June 10th when my plane left from Kansas City at 7:00 pm. The plan was to fly to Chicago and then catch a 9:15pm international flight to Barcelona. Then by 9:30 pm June 11th I would be in Amman, Jordan. However, things did not go as planned when my Kansas flight got diverted from Chicago to Madison, Wisconsin due to a storm. Since then, it has been nothing but a nightmare and dissatisfaction with American airlines. In Madison, I waited in line for over three hours along with other passengers to make travel arrangements and hotel reservations. I was the last person to leave the airport, around 2:30am on June 11. The AA staff then assured me that he made my reservations and had rebooked all of my flights through the rest of my international, arrangement. He printed me the boarding pass to Chicago and also to Paris. He informed me to come back in the morning to check-in my bag and sent me off to a hotel. Well, I was back by 9:30am at the airport to start my journey. I checked in and got my boarding passes to Chicago and to Paris. However, the staff informed me that since they made my connections through Delta, they wouldn’t be able to print the boarding pass from Paris to Jordan and that I would have to do that in Paris when I landed. However, they assured me that all is good and that my bag, has a label to AMM; it will continue to Amman. I took their word and got on a plane to Chicago; landed there and continued to my Paris flight. Seven hours later I landed in Terminal 2A in Paris at 10:05 am, June 12th. My supposed flight to Jordan was going to leave around 3pm. So, I ran to get to terminal 2E. I did get there, but I needed a boarding pass to cross through security. First, I tried the kiosks, but was not successful. I talked to an Air France person who informed me there was something wrong with my booking and that I needed to speak with Air France customer service. Luckily, it was just a few feet away; however, the line was 100 feet long. So, I waited in line for 90 minutes. When I got to the customer service representative, they informed me that my reservation was not done correctly by AA and it was cancelled. They told me that the plane to Jordan was full. The representative also said that I would need to talk to American Airlines to fix their mistake and rebook me on another flight. This meant, I had to run back to terminal 2A. I did run to Terminal 2A to find AA counters closed for the day as their last flight was leaving. Luckily, there was somebody trying to get to the locked office who agreed to try to help. Now it was past 1pm, 3 hours after I arrived and I didn’t know if I would ever leave the airport and join my family who travelled one day before me on Sat. Thinking I will be joining them just a day later. It is now 2 days later and God knows where my bag is now. After about 40 minutes, the AA staff told me that he booked me on two Turkish lines arriving in Amman by 11:55pm.

American Airlines,1,V Gurlen,18th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Charlotte to Palm Beach. This airline has often changed our flight times and seats. What is the point of setting up days off and meetings if the airline cannot stick to the schedule they came up with?

What is the point of only having Wi Fi entertainment if the plane has no electric plugs to keep your device powered for 7 hours? I fly several times per year from Florida to the mid west and west coast. On this particular flight the flight attendant passed my row for snacks and drinks. Flight was delayed for departure and I was hungry. I asked her for a snack when she two rows back, rather then walk back two rows she said she would come back.

We were two adults and 5 children between 10 and 15 years old. From check in staff In Dublin, to the flight crew, everything was above average. Many reviews complained about the seats, how uncomfortable they are and their pitch. This seems to be a problem with Boeing as the 4 Airbus planes we flew were comfortable and more than adequate. One issue we had which did leave a bad taste with all of us was the check In attendant in Orlando. We each had 23kg baggage allowance. On average we only had 10 kg each. We asked to check in one of the children’s cabin baggage and were instructed that this would cost a further $100 as 7 albeit light bags had been checked in. We had to retrieve one of the bags to add her toiletries, as they would have been confiscated, necessitating 45 minutes of waiting for the bag to come back.

We were scheduled to fly in December 12, 2017 to Puerto Rico and had been saving up to go all out with First Class tickets which is an extreme luxury for us. Due to the devestation of Hurricane Maria we cancelled our flight and were told we had a year to reuse our tickets. I tried to make my new reservation on Aug. 10, 2018 and was declined to use my credit because the credit was only valid until year from the date of purchase which was Aug. 7, 2017 and not from the ticketed departure date of Dec. 12, 2017. That is right, I was 3 days late. Needless to say I was very upset and made a formal request begging for a 3 day extension in order to uae my almost $2,100 credit and this is the message I just received 3 days after my request. I'm sorry that you didn't travel with us as planned nor were you able to use the value of your unused tickets within a year. We know that travel doesn't always happen as planned, which is why we give our customers one year from the date the original ticket was issued to begin new travel. We believe that offering a full year to rebook travel provides our customers the flexibility they need to use their flight credit. I'm sorry for any disappointment we might cause by declining your request. Let me assure you that our position does not lessen our regard for you as our customer. It is always our pleasure to serve you, and I hope that we have the opportunity to welcome you aboard again soon. This is the same as stealing!!! I did not lose $300 or $500 it was almost $2,100 of my hard earned money saved up to to have a dream vacation and due to circumstances out of my control (mother nature) I had to cancel my original vacation and was excited to plan it again for this year only to find out I was 3 days too late!

American Airlines,1,Andrea Everage,10th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I booked a trip via American Airlines on July 7th to travel from Gainesville, FL to Boston, MA on Friday, August 3rd. I checked in the day before the flight and woke up at 4am so I could be ready for the 6:27am departure time. I was to go from Gainesville to Miami, FL. I was supposed to depart Miami, FL at 8:34am and arrive in Boston at 11:51am, where my ride would be waiting. I was notified at 5:18am that my flight had been delayed and we would depart at 7:30am, thereby making me miss my connecting flight in Miami. There was no reason given for delay. Then I was notified at 6:22am that the flight was cancelled. No reason given. I was to be rebooked on a flight that would arrive in Boston at 12:47am the following morning. I let the desk agent at Gainesville know this would not work for me. They rebooked my flight from the Orlando airport to Charlotte, NC and the soonest they could get me in would be 5:11pm to Boston. They sent me on a shuttle to the Orlando airport where we were delayed yet again taking off. We were delayed 30 minutes in Charlotte, then sat on the tarmac for 2 hours. It was awful. I ended up arriving into Boston at 8pm. I was tired, upset and had missed my ride. When I tried to get reimbursed for my time and the inconvenience, American Airlines Customer Solutions offered 7500 bonus miles, which is embarrassingly meager and anyway, I wouldn’t fly with them again if they were the last airline available. I was never told why there were so many delays or why my flight was cancelled on August 3rd. American Airlines has awful customer service, lacks the desire to communicate and does not value customer satisfaction.

American Airlines,6,Eric Willianms,9th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Paris CDG to New York. A bit of an ""airline-geek"" I used a convenient website to discover that our B767 was 23.7 years old. Traveling International Business, I was hoping that the plane would be retrofitted with modern amenities. Firstly, the Admirals Club at CDG is magnificent - food...liquor, work-space, relaxing areas; this club puts USA clubs to shame! The plane looked old; the bathrooms were atrocious but functioning but, the seats were fantastic. IFE via Samsung tablet was sufficient. First thing I noticed was the myriad of uniforms and attitudes from the 8 flight attendants. Safety is paramount but, service is what can make or break the passenger's perspective. Each FA wore a different uniform, except for the younger staff, who represented the airline with proper etiquette. Tie, no tie, blue shirt, white shirt, grey jersey dress, etc., it was was mix-match that sent an unprofessional message. Sadly the warmth and service suffered from the same issue. The FA in Business Class functioned. There was no extra sense that I was flying in a ""Flagship"" experience. Nothing was offered other than the typical drink, dinner and snack. No walk-through the cabins to offer additional aperitifs or any other needs or niceties. The much boasted wine-pairing was not even mentioned. The main starters were poor; not every one likes cold salmon and celery/radish salad. Main plate was OK, certainly not what I have experienced on other carriers including Delta and Cathay Pacific! Asking for dessert to be offered a little later after lunch, the FA serving the 14 of us conveniently forgot. I did however get a cold cup of coffee after troubling the FA - and that's what I felt, like I was a trouble. I understand that working with the public can be aggravating and perhaps working conditions within the employee union may effect attitude but, the service and food quality was extremely poor. The most gracious staff member on the flight was the Captain who was so appreciative that we chose AA! We arrived safely but the seven hours in air was mediocre and truly representative of a 3 star airline. Hey American why not try for a 4 or 5 star rating. But, that might take a lot of hard work, an attitude change and perhaps a uniform that all can wear and be proud of.",Boeing 767-300,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Paris CDG to New York,August 2018,5,1,2,2,4,3,yes

American Airlines,1,Kurt Kipfer,5th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | This flight segment was the absolute worst flight have had the displeasure of in my 54 years. Apparently, there was poor weather in the area/in route to Charlotte, NC where I was supposed to catch a connecting flight to return to Indianapolis, which was my final destination. At HPN, a Jet Blue flight was canceled out of the blue right before AA flight #5180. Jet Blue would not let any passengers board the plane. 10 minutes later, AA began boarding flight 5180 from HPN to Charlotte. We pushed away from the gate on time, the pilot informed us we should be arriving on time to Charlotte. Then everything came to a stop. 2PM. We sat on the plane for a hour. Weather impacting the departure. The pilot informed us that an alternate route was being filed to skirt the bad weather but due to this refiled flight plan, we would need more refueling. 3PM. No one was allowed to exit the plane. I repeat no one was allowed to exit the plane! 330PM. Now, the plane resumes its place in line further back in the pack. We wait. 4PM. The pilot announced that the refiled flight plan has ""dropped out of the system"". Passengers sigh. Attendants offer water service for the 1st/only time. 500PM. We continue to wait. My seatmate informs me that fed regulations limit max tarmac stagnation at 3 hours. The attendant informs us that the refueling reset the time counter. How convenient?

Walked up to the check in clerk this morning and was met with some of the worst attitude I have dealt with traveling (and I travel a lot). She spent more time trying to lecture me like a child than trying to get me on my flight, after causing me to miss the flight she finished her lecture with ""you and your handicap brother will be lucky to travel together being that your whole trip is now stand by, good luck). So I asked to chat with the supervisor who I guess was at the gate, so we proceeded to the gate, we arrived at the gate still with plenty of time to board the plane that we had already been kicked off because the agent was too lazy to check and rush one bag to the plane. As I arrived at the gate I asked for supervisor and when she appeared I asked are you a manager, her response was ""yes I dont have much time what do you want?"" Taken back once again by the courteous and helpful nature of the now management I said ""would you like to wait to chat with me until you have more time?"" She then peered at me with a cold glare and asked me to continue. I explained the attitude I encountered at the front counter she showed no element of caring and proceeded to tell me if I'm not 1.5 hours early there is no guarantee the staff at AA will do their job and get you on the flight. Other passengers were pervy to my conversation and began to share their stories of rude counter staff here today too. As a seasoned traveler I've seen every aspect of good and bad customer service is this is terrible. Many airlines will bend over backwards to get you on you flights knowing that sometimes we (customers) run a little behind and sometimes you (airlines) run behind and the end goal is transported happy customers. The attitude of the AA staff today was more like your late, here is a unnecessary lecture about being early now your screwed good luck.

American Airlines,1,Deborah P Conroy,1st August 2018,"Not Verified | Buffalo to Philadelphia was fine. Not comfortable, but adequate. However, the connecting flight from Philadelphia to BWI was first delayed multiple times, and finally (an hour and a half later) cancelled altogether. According to the boarding desk personal, flights were being cancelled due to ""congestion."" Connecting flight was supposed to depart at 8:05 am, but due to all flights to BWI by American out of Philadelphia that day, the first available flight out was at 5:55 pm, which meant my afternoon meeting in Washington was impossible. Apparently Philadelphia to Baltimore was not the only flight cancelled out of Philadelphia that day; there were hundreds of people stranded by American that morning. I did manage to get a rental car and DROVE the rest of the way. Submitting for a refund was also fraught with difficulty and in the end, my $190 aborted flight wound up costing me $327 ($190 + $215 car rental + $18 unknown fee charged to my account by American Airlines two days after the flight date - $96 refund) (I have no idea what the $18 is for.

They closed the cargo door and maintenance performed pressure check and we boarded the flight again, three hours later. I’ve contacted American Airlines several times to find our how they can miss a cargo door not being sealed prior to take off. The flight crew was blaming the Chicago ground crew. This concerns me regarding safety for future flights. American Airlines has been dismissive and has responded that they simply don’t have that information and there is no one that they can direct me to for answers. Pathetic.

Parents traveling with kids, elderly persons on wheelchairs, etc and AA said that they could not provide any food, hotel,taxi.

Soon later, they made everyone get off of the plane because it was too hot on the plane and the air conditioner wasn’t effective, and they ran out of drinking water. We get off of the plane and wait for an update. No accurate update was given. We were simply told that the weather was bad and that now our Captain can’t fky because he’s over his time. They called several more captains and it was too late for them all to fly. They finally found a captain that Can fly. We get back in the plane, which was crammed. We waited almost an hour. I asked the flight attendant what was going on and what time we were taking off. She said she did not know. I asked for water because it was very hot and was told they ran out still. So we were going to be on a 3 hour flight with no water. Soon later, we all get texts that our flight was cancelled. We asked the flight attendant and they had no information. Finally we were told by the captian that it was cancelled. It was past 12am at this point. It took forever for them to re-in-board the plane.

The only snack your offered are pretzels. I also didn't get my bag about 12 to 12:30. The constant delays were unreal. I didn't get settled at home until 1:30 in the morning, which caused problems for me the next day. Then when I opened my luggage the next day it was clear that my luggage was handled extremely poorly. I wrapped a glass picture frame in clothes so it wouldn't get damaged in flight as I've done before with delta without a fragile sticker being placed on it and with delta it would always be fine, when I opened my bag the frame was shattered and the broken glass had ruined my picture. There was also a 10min delay getting off of the plane.

At that moment, the flight was still supposed to fly at 10 pm, so I decided to stick to it and I checked my suitcase in. After that, they keep sending the delay notifications, which ended up saying ""the flight was cancelled and your new flight is 5:25 am one"" As expected, they never provided any reasons at all and I was kicked out of the security area around 12am, which forced me to spend some 4 hours outside and come back to line up for the security again around 4 am. When I asked about my suitcase I checked in at the gate after this reschedule, the crew said ""that is a separated system and we have no information."" The new flight departed without any trouble and I got my suitcase at Philly airport, which was the only good news.

I usually prefer to travel with American Airlines as I have enjoyed their customer services until today when in two occasions was treated very rudely by two of their associates. People like that shouldn't work in customer service as it ruins the good reputation of a business.

American Airlines,2,Raghav Nookala,16th July 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I flew American Airlines on business trips domestic and international numerous times but never with family on an intentional trip. Unfortunately I did travel this time and I swear not to do the same mistake again. I wanted to request a vegetarian meal for my family and I could not figure how to do it from the website that I visit almost every week. I end up calling customer service and they had to update the meal preference. However they miss updating one of the family members and guess what, 2 Asian vegetarian meals for 3 of us. I was traveling with an infant, so requested a bassinet almost 2 months in advance. Even called the customer service and I get a standard response that I need to request at the airport. I am a platinum pro traveler and I still could not block any bulkhead rows because I had a lap child in the reservation. I go to the airport 3.5 hours before the departure time and request bassinet. I was told that I need to contact the gate agent. I go ask the gate agent and she tells me that no bulk head seats are available as all of those seats were sold at a premium to other passengers. When I checked out those seats, there were no infants in them. This was a shocker. My next 2 legs were with Etihad and they had the bulk head rows assigned to us even before requesting them. The air hostesses were arrogant and would not like to entertain simple questions like “hey do have some fruits for the kids?” I specifically asked for the name to complain and she would not divulge her name. A simple yes or know would have sufficed but all I get is ""Why are you bothering me"" look. This kind of behavior deters families traveling with American and could cost in the long run. No point in whining about Middle East airlines capturing the international travel market. Not because of their price but because of their service. Companies that ignore customer service have perished. Better learn the lesson and improve. Business travelers travel alone (1 ticket) but families (3-4 tickets on average). Wake up before it is too late.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to London,July 2018,3,1,1,1,3,2,no

They keep changing the time every hour with different arguments. It shows clearly their inability to say the truth. I flew with them five times and four times I had delays of over 4 to 5 hours.

The attendant’s 1st option with handling me was to call security, no compassion or customer service or people skills. She wouldn’t explain to me the policy or other alternatives.

I was okay with that since we heard there were issues there for the previous days. What happened next is beyond irritating. On Wednesday we boarded the plane in Newport News and was later deplaned due to a brake issue. They rescheduled our flights for the next day and changed our location to an airport 45 minutes away (Norfolk, VA). On Thursday, they canceled our flight again stating that there was no crew to fly the plane out of Norfolk. So in the end we got to Hawaii on Friday, three days later, a shortened vacation and the worst part, we missed my niece’s wedding! What do you think they did to compensate us? Keep in mind between my husband and myself we sent American five emails regarding this situation. Their solution, give us 15,000 miles! Really, who would want to fly with them after this.

American Airlines,1,R Cawlie,10th July 2018,✅ Trip Verified | Miami to new York JFK. Boarded the plane and pulled away from gate only to find out twenty minutes in that we needed air pressure and a boost and we waited 3 hours with no air in 100 degree weather in Miami just for mechanics to come fix the problem that they said was no big deal. Then we had to wait about an extra hour for a push car to come push the plane and only the crew shows up without the starter car! Had to wait another half hour for them to find the car . And all this we were only told 2.5 hours in that we may leave the plane but the kicker is they were not giving back luggage and were putting whoever wanted to leave on standby to wait whenever they decide to give you another flight. They said it could be tonight tomorrow or next week. How convenient. Who is going to go anywhere without their luggage? Basically didn’t make sense for anyone to leave so we had no choice. On top of all that the flight attendants were the laziest I ever met. I am 6 months pregnant with an 8 month old baby. We were both sweating and overheated. My baby couldn’t even eat it was so hot for her and I asked one for water about an hour in and she pointed to her metal cabinet draws where the water is. Was I supposed to get it myself ? Who knows. I had to start crying to finally get water. Then they said that maybe they should start giving out some water. Maybe? Is that a joke. People are dehydrating. When my husband asked one for iced water she just stared at him with a blank face she only got it once he yelled and then she got mad he yelled ! They only started giving out water about two hours in and had to ration it because they ran out. People had connecting flights in JFK that they missed and you would think they gate manager would help them reschedule or provide them with a compensation but no. Our only compensation was a movie and 1 pack of cookies. I could go on and on. So unprofessional so lazy so incompetent.

After the 5th missed flight, I finally folded and bought a ticket myself ($65) so I could get home. Since I bought this ticket the morning of, I was on boarding group 9. This means that you’re only allowed one personal item which was never conveyed to me. Even though my bag was carry-on size, I had to pay $50 for them to check my bag as I was boarding because I was in group 9 and that’s not allowed apparently, and they were out of room in the overhead storage bins since THEY oversold the flight.

American Airlines,3,M Calder,4th July 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Denver to Gatwick via Orlando. Worst experience, will not do it again. I was flying unaccompanied with a toddler on this trip. I intentionally booked flights that had a couple layovers thinking it would give the baby the opportunity to get out and about to do something else on a long journey. These layovers is where all the trouble started. Flew from Denver to North Carolina and made the connection without a hitch. Then from North Carolina to Orlando before heading to London. My flight coming into Orlando arrived late. By the time I was able to de-board the plane my connection was boarding in another terminal, completely on the other side of the airport where I had to leave and re-enter security to get there. Since I was carrying a 30+ lb. Toddler and a 15+ lb carseat I tried to ask for help to get where I needed to go quickly. The gate agents response (at every stop) was it's faster just to do it yourself. So nowI sprint across all of the Orlando airport get to security only to find the boarding passes they sent me for my British Airways connection don't work. Security tells me I have to go to the ticket counter to get new passes .my flight is boarding as we speak. I run to the ticket counter, loaded down with baby & her stuff to find no one at the counter. Talk to the American Airlines representative (flight is booked as american airlines, operated as british airways) to be informed they can't do anything they will have to see if there is someone around for British Airways. Find someone, get my boarding pass, make it through security get on the plane with 3 minutes to spare. Coming back was worse. Flight out of Florida was delayed 2 hours causing me to miss my connection. After flying 9 hours with a toddler, going through customs in and out of security and hauling around all the baby gear they wanted to put me on a connecting flight to get home the following moring! Finally found 1 gate agent who sympathized and managed to get me the last 2 seats on the last flight that night. However; when arriving for my connection in Dallas they changed the arrival gate to another terminal completely across the airport. Once again the connection was boarding, asked gate agents for help to get across the airport quickly and was told it was faster to do it myself. RAN with toddler and accessories across all of DFW. As a mother of 3, two who are now grown I remember gate agents and airport staff being much more helpful with families flying with young children. Apparently preboarding for parents flying with young children doesn't exist to this airline anymore. When I asked the rep almost laughed at me. It only makes sense so that parents can get kids settled and out of the way of other boarding passengers. Instead I got to stand in the isle, hold up traffic flow and apologize repeatedly to everyone around me while I tried to get the baby in. On the flight back from London to Florida (9 hours) the movies on my daughter TV didn't work and they couldn't do anything to fix it. I could not get wifi to entertain her. The whole travel part of the trip was a complicated mess.

American Airlines,10,W Nelson,3rd July 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Rome to Detroit via Philadelphia. I’ve had my share of bad travel experiences and it’s often I compelled me to write nasty reviews, so it’s only fair that when I have a really great experience I write a fitting review as well. Classic situation- our flight from Rome to Philadelphia (AA 719) was delayed for about two hours, which caused us to miss our connecting flight (with Dreaded Delta) from Philadelphia to our home in Detroit . Very rarely does this pan out in the travelers favor. Great customer service isn’t born by perfection; not every flight is on time, and mistakes are made. Great customer service is all about making it right. Like all travelers in this situation, I just wanted to get home and that’s exactly what happened. American ended up booking us on a full flight about an hour after our original flight into Detroit, causing minimal inconvenience. Free of charge. Technically speaking I think AA had no obligation to do this and that Delta, if anyone, would have issued us new tickets (and no, we did not have insurance). Beyond that, I have to say that the staff of flight AA 719 was the most professional, pleasant and fun crew I have been around over probably a hundred flights. Both the staff on the flight and the representatives I spoke to on the phone (especially supervisor Leslie) were extremely helpful and understanding of our situation. They had rules and protocol and they broke them to help us — they treated us like individuals and not like numbers. That is the hallmark of a class organization. Generally speaking, when I select flights I’m looking more for price and timing. In the future I’m going to lean towards American Airlines. We could very easily have missed our flight, bought new tickets, hotel accommodations, a last second extra day off work, etc — that happens to people every day.

My flight to San Francisco was supposed to depart at 7:50 pm and the crew had us waiting for 2 hours in the plane while fixing Documents. The problem is that they didn’t keep us informed as to what was happening. Then we got sent to another aircraft because apparently the one we were originally didn’t pass the test when it should’ve been tested beforehand. While we are waiting on the second flight after 4 hours of waiting then the crew disappears and we have not pilot.

We flew from Chicago heading to Charlotte and after half an hour in the air the captain had to land back to Chicago due to a smell coming out of the AC. This caused connecting flights to be missed and took us more than 6 hours to catch a flight to Jamaica. On the way back, we had a 2 hour delay at Charlotte pushing the take off time to 1am without notifying customers that check points at CLT closes at 9:45pm. Yes, if your flight is late at night you have to check in before 9:45pm or otherwise you can't make it to the gate.

I was asked to renew the AA form signed by my doctor 48 hours before the flight. I had been doing this for the last 4 years. I sent the completed form 3 days before the flight I got an email back saying they needed the date the therapist was licensed not the date it expired and the name of her business. I emailed back that she was in private practice and gave the date she was licensed. The day of my flight, I checked in for my flight and was asked for a copy of the service animal form, which I presented and was issued boarding passes, with a stopover in Dallas. When I got to Dallas and boarding the flight to NY with my dog, I was pulled aside and told I couldn't board the flight. Now I had my boarding pass, my suit cases were on the plane, and my little dog was in tow. I said ""What, you've got to be kidding?"". This very rude employee brusque told me he wanted to my paperwork, which I gave to him. He told me I couldn't board the flight because I needed a letter from my doctor with her letterhead and I didn't have it. I told him I was never asked for that, just the AA form. He said the only way I could board the flight was to pay $250. I said I would if this would help expedite and we could sort it out later. Then he told me then I would need a dog carrier to board the plane, which I didn't have as this wasn't required for emotional support animals. I told him this was not right, I had followed the online requirements and showed him my AA form and my emails with the SAC (Special Assistance Coordinator). I asked him to call his supervisor, which he did. All of this took about 30 minutes. Now the plane was fully boarded and he was not going to let me on this flight. Seconds before the flight left, finally his supervisor agreed I could get on the plane. The doors were now locked to the hallway and he couldn't open them, he was having a meltdown, until another employee who had the gate opener helped him out. I was literally overwhelmed and terrorized (create and maintain a state of extreme fear and distress in (someone); fill with terror.)

From Lima to Miami, their on board meal only included an omelet or a ham and cheese sandwich. We all ordered the omelet (a family of 5 people) since no one of us eats pork meat; however after the second bite I discovered that it has bacon in it. The flight attendants never mentioned that. I asked if they have any other options they denied with an attitude (I felt like they are doing me a favor even though I paid over $3000 for the trip). From Miami to Norfolk, I ordered a beer. The flight attendant served everybody but me. When I asked her again she pointed to my wife who she gave 2 beers and she said “there she got yours..” even though my wife ordered just for her. Later, I asked for another beer. The flight attendant claimed that they are out even though she listed many beer brands options to a guy was sitting right in front of me and she never served anymore after him (I knew this because the airplane was super small and the kitchen was right behind me). So technically the flight attendant never served me a thing for the whole time I was on board… (Very rude and unprofessional).

We had children at home and our sitter was leaving the next day so we had to get home, so being put on stand by with 100 other people was not an option for us. So we rented a car and drove for 9 hours. When we emailed the airline (there is no phone number to call according to the staff) they said we ""elected"" to take a car and they would not reimburse us. The refund for the ticket didn't even cover the cost of the car (because it was from a different state).

American Airlines,1,Brooke Lowry,28th June 2018,"Not Verified | Arrived at curbside check in at 5:30 am for a 6:43 departure (Tampa to Greensboro, via Charlotte. Then later that afternoon I was scheduled to leave Greensboro on a direct flight to Philadelphia and returning to Tampa the following day). Stand at curbside for ten minutes or so waiting for “computer problems” to be resolved so I can check my one bag. Finally gave up and went inside. Stood in that line for I guess another fifteen minutes or so because by the time it was my turn I was one minute ... yes, one minute inside the 45 minute cutoff to check a bag. What ensued over the next ten or fifteen minutes is not even worth going into, but suffice it to say that due to the ineptitude and uncaring of this “customer service representative” and his even more inept and uncaring supervisor, I missed a domestic flight I arrived an hour and fifteen minutes early for and was put on standby for the next one which was going to get me in an hour later than my first meeting was scheduled to start. While waiting on standby at the gate, I happened to start chatting with a girl sitting next to me, and turns out she is an AA employee’s daughter, and tells me somewhat sheepishly that it is AA policy to overbook every flight by at least five seats and their workaround is that any preferred status members who want on a flight can get on because they will work the system to get idiots like me who had the audacity to want to check a piece of luggage to “miss” their flight by milking the clock and then invoking FAA regulations. By some miracle, I did get on the standby flight, made it to Charlotte and on to Greensboro and went to baggage claim to get my bag. Guess what? No bag. A patently disinterested, gum-popping employee in the baggage office told me that my bag had been checked on to Philadelphia because “this isn’t where you are actually going.” Oh no? Then why am I here now? Too much in a hurry to worry about it, I left to get to what was left of my meetings and returned to the airport in Greensboro. With time in hand before my flight I decided to check and see if a different employee might have some other info about the bag containing my meeting clothes and other necessities for my meeting the following morning that I now hadn’t seen for almost twelve hours. This woman, who was actually nice enough, unlike everyone else I had dealt with so far, proceeded to tell me in about 0.2 seconds that yes, in fact, my bag was already in Philadelphia. The amazing part was that she hadn’t looked at my baggage claim ticket or touched her computer so I guess she was a psychic? Apparently a bad one, however, because when pressed she admitted she had no basis for that claim and decided maybe sne should call someone (never did say who or where) and double check, at which point she says that in fact my bag has very considerately been held here for me in Greensboro and will be joining me on the plane to Philadelphia. Super. Only guess what? I land in Philadelphia and there is no bag waiting for me there, so once again I head for the baggage office of AA. Luck happened to be with me this time and I happened to get helped by a wonderful person named Zakiyah who patiently worked to disentangle all of the lies, ineptitude and misinformation that had been dogging my poor little suitcase all day long and finally deduced that it had been taken off the plane and put on the wrong conveyor in another terminal and was revolving forlornly on a conveyor belt a few buildings over",,Business,Economy Class,Tampa to Philadelphia via Greensboro,June 2018,1,1,1,,1,1,no

I was scheduled to depart from MIA Friday at 5:40pm to land in Charolette where I then had a direct flight back to MSP. My scheduled arrival time in MSP was 12:20am Saturday. We started the boarding process where group 1 was starting to board. Then an announcement was made that there was a flat tire on the plane and they needed an hour to replace the tire. Half hour later we had a weather delay, no big deal its weather not their fault. After the weather cleared the work on the tire never started and another announcement was made that they needed an hour to fix the tire. These series of delays caused connection issues with other travelers and my connection was now in jepordy. After the repairs were made and driving around on the runway we finally departed at 9:40pm. We landed in Charolette around 1045pm, my flight to MSP left 20 min before I landed. After talking with an employee about needing to get home I had to spend the night in a questionable hotel that American Airlines paid for and gave me a $12 meal voucher. I arrived at the hotel at 12:30am (Same time I should have landed back home). Instead of having a direct flight from CLT to MSP I had to fly to ORD at 9:40am then land at MSP by 3:05pm. No issues flying to ORD (I was shocked), but now another issue with the plane. After the plane arrived from Las Vegas we started boarding again by calling group 1 then announcing we had to delay because of fluid leaking in the engine. Another delay of 1 hour. The announced that the plane had to be decommissioned and a new plane had to be brought in as a replacement. We finally took off from ORD around 3pm (Again the same time I should have been home). All the delays and setbacks caused my fees in the parking ramp to skyrocket. My overall experience with American Airlines was horrible. I have never been part of so many delays and questioned the overall safety of planes by one fleet. If a plane landed that had fluid leaking in an engine shouldn't that have set off an alarm? Why would they try and board knowing there was an issue on the plane? Also the on flight entertainment is the same level as Spirit airlines, there is none.

First and foremost when I booked my flight, I booked it so I would leave out of my home city Sarasota/Bradenton. I was to leave at 5:00 on a Friday morning. At 10:30 p.m. on Thursday I get a text that my flight has been cancelled. Of course I immediately call AA and am told it will take one and half to two hours before I even get a return call. I wait for about an hour and try again. Rather than giving me the call back option this time, they recognize my number and ask me to hold. I do so for about 45 minutes. Eventually I get a customer service representative and my only option is to fly out of Tampa airport the next morning. They initially had me rebooked on a 10:30 a.m. Flight from Tampa but by the time I got into Nashville and then drove two hours to where my daughter lives, all of Friday would have been wasted. So I rebooked on a 5:00 a.m. Flight, getting into Nashville at the same time I would have if my Sarasota flight hadn't been cancelled. By this time it's 1:00 or so in the morning. That leaves me about an hour's worth of sleeping time before I have to get up and leave for the Tampa airport. While I made the flight on time and the customer service representative was very helpful in getting me on that flight, the fact remains I had to drive an hour to the airport and park my car whereas if I had left from Sarasota like I normally do, I would have used Uber and not incurred $90 in parking fees (plus two hours of driving time and tolls).

The ground crew was heard saying they did not have enough maintenance people working on a Sunday afternoon. The dinner service once onboard was rushed and unpleasant and I chalked it up to the late take off. Not so, because the service from the flight attendants on the return trip was just as shabby. FA were unfriendly, unhelpful, and at times rude or condescending towards passengers. They acted as if they did not want to be there doing this job. I was in the new Premium Economy cabin and paid a lot more than an economy fare for my ticket. I feel the higher cost should include better service, not just a bigger seat. The new Premium Economy passengers had to go sometimes to the very back of the plane and through the galley to use a vacant lavatory. Forget stretching your legs on a long flight by walking to the back as the aisles are so narrow in the Main Cabin one can not avoid bumping seated passengers.There was no offer of refills on the free alcohol drinks.

I’ve been flying International for years with Delta and United Airlines, never had an issue arriving 90 min prior. We arrived at 5am for our 6.30 flight, the line was at end of the opposite side of the airport (only airline that had any line) they had 7 different airplanes leaving within minutes of each other. We finally get to the front, our attendant is assisting another attendant who is having a hard time explaining to another customer about their cat boarding, took another 10 minutes to assist us, finally gets to us “sorry they’ve closed the check in 5 minutes ago”. They rebooked for the next day with a 6 hour lay over in Dallas. I’ve been on hold for 50 minutes now (and counting) to try to get fly us one day after our scheduled back date.

American Airlines,1,C Barnet,21st June 2018,✅ Trip Verified | Florence to Seattle via Charlotte. I am highly disappointed in American this morning. Had a 5:50 am flight out of Florence and right in the middle of boarding they cancel our flight which caused me to miss my connecting flight to Seattle. The inconsiderate way the staff handle it made it even worse basically saying you either drive to CLT or they will provide Uber to but won’t assure that we will miss the new flight that was scheduled. Needless to say I miss the another flight en route and get here having to go through TSA once again then sent back to even more difficult customer service reps was a nightmare. Getting told my 4pm flight may be oversold etc and there isn’t another flight until much later or even tomorrow has me so upset I can cry. I don’t usually complain being that I fly out 2 to 3 times a month and understand things happen but maintenance issues or crew issues are solely under the control of American Airlines how they handle these conditions are primarily left up to staff and reflects their company. But these people so rude and just don’t care I think I’ll be going back to Delta after this one,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Florence to Seattle via Charlotte,June 2018,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,Jacob Walker,21st June 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I booked a flight on American Airlines flying out on June 15 to see my mother for the last time she was placed in hospice. I showed up to the airport in plenty of time only to find out that my flight was delayed after waiting for about an hour after the original take off time I was told the flight was canceled. Employees at the desk said that I could wait for the next flight which flew out the next day or I could rent a rental car and be reimbursed for the cost of the rental car. I decided since time is of the essence and my mom was not doing well that I would Drive eight hours from North Carolina to Alabama to be with her. After driving all night and not getting any sleep I got to Alabama around six in the morning and spent my mothers final hours with her before she passed that evening. When we woke up on Sunday, June 17 my wife could not find my flight record anywhere. After spending an hour and a half on the phone waiting for a customer service rep she got disconnected called back and left a callback number which took over two hours and finally got the flight rebooked. Around 4 PM we got an update from the American airline app saying the flight had once again been canceled my wife got back on the phone and was able to reschedule my flight through Delta putting me home around 2 AM. Now we are trying to get A refund issued on a flight we paid insurance for but have called customer service numerous times tried to use the website to find out how to get a refund and it keeps saying the flight was not canceled but I canceled the flight with the customer service reps at the airport. The amount of hassle and time and money that we have had to spend has been ridiculous especially having to deal with this with the death of my mother. The rental car that I got cost me over $500 with the rental and gas and I’m finding out it’s going to take a long time to get that money refunded. No one should have to wait on the phone for upwards of 5 to 6 hours altogether in the matter of two days and not have any resolution as far as how to cancel flights get refunds or get any help at all. The hoops we have had to jump through just to make sure I made it to my mothers and home when I needed to be had been exhausting and is making an already hard and stressful situation harder. All we are asking for is a refund of the rental car and flight I couldn’t take due to the airline canceling the flight originally but the airline is telling us they will not refund the car because the employee at the airline did not record it, we will only be refunded around $76 for the leg of the flight that was cancelled when the flight cost $484 so half of that should be refunded and are only going to give us a $300 flight voucher when we never fly so we will not use the flight voucher.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Greensboro to Hunstville,June 2018,1,1,,,1,1,no

The Airbus aircraft was perfect and the flight was very good with minor turbulence however somehow I felt unhappy with cabin staff with the exception of a greek speaking steward. Dinner was below average for such a long flight, (10 hours) and so was the miserable ""breakfast"" just before landing.

American Airlines,1,T Barden,19th June 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Our flight this evening was delayed 4 times over 3 hours due to bad weather in Chicago. At 9pm we were informed that our flight had been rescheduled for 9:30am the next morning. I understand you can't control the weather, but by this time there were no other flights leaving Raleigh (or the surrounding area) until at least 7am the next morning. I had an important event to attend in Chicago the next morning. When I approached the agent you could tell right away that she didn't care. I tried to find an earlier flight from a nearby area or even just one that got me close to Illinois. I offered to drive from Raleigh part way to catch a flight or even drive from outside Chicago a couple hours...if she could just get me close. The response I received was that my request was too difficult and required too much work on her part. I then asked if there was someone else who could help me and she said I was free to go wait in line again for someone else who might be more willing to spend the time assisting me in getting to my destination. (point to note: there was no one behind me in line) I was frustrated and started to break down into tears (that's how important this event was) but all she did was pick at her nail polish and repeat the phrase 'you will not be making it to Chicago by tomorrow morning.' She then proceeded to tell me that I was not eligible for a hotel voucher because I was not based out of Raleigh? Well played. I travel a decent amount and have a lot of patience for people dealing with travel issues. Travel delays happen and I accommodate, but this time I really needed to get somewhere and American Airlines missed the mark. The least she could have done is shown a little compassion but no, I was treated like I was there to serve her needs as she saw fit. Would it have been so hard for her to ask someone else to help me?

American Airlines,1,Sumeet Singla,13th June 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | They don’t really care about customer relations. I have seen several times that they overbook the flights when seriously, with advent of technology, it can clearly be avoided. They don’t even have enough staff at airports to run things smoothly. Let me tell you what I went through: 1) First my flight from Cedar Rapids to Chicago was delayed by 3 hours. You know how far Chicago is from Cedar Rapids? Just 30 minutes if we go by air. This has happened to me twice. You know airlines from other countries are carrying passengers on their transatlantic flights without delays, cancellations and excellent customer service. Its about time they visit those countries and take a lesson on how to provide a valuable customer service. 2) Then, they let everyone board the plane but somehow manage to find an excuse to not take off. We had to wait for take-off on tarmac for 2 hours and on top of that, the pilot doesn’t even announce periodically what is going on. This was agonizing for so many passengers. I purposely selected this flight because I had a 3 hour layover in Chicago and I was going to meet my friend, but because of delays caused by American Airlines, I will have to wait for another couple of months. Don’t even tell me it was a weather related delay as it was sunny! They clearly either didn’t have pilots or planes to provide the service and yet, booked us knowing very well that their services were not adequate in any way. I reached Chicago Airport at 5.30 pm when I was supposed to arrive there around 2.30 pm. But this was just the beginning. 3) Then while waiting for my next plane out of Chicago to Newark, they very cleverly increased the delay by 15-20 minutes at one time so that customers don’t cancel with them and fly with any other airlines because when you incrementally delay flights by 15 minutes, customers are more likely to stay with that particular airline in order to reach their destination. Whereas, if you had displayed from the beginning that it was 2-3 hours delay, customers were more likely to look for other options to reach their destination. 4) Then we boarded the plane at 8.30 pm, 2.5 hours after scheduled time and the same thing happened. We were on the runway for the next 2.5 hours. 2.5 hours! For what? No one knows. Crew failed to provide any update. There was no weather delays again. After 2.5 hours, the pilot turned the plane back to gate telling that he has completed his hours and couldn’t fly. Tell me about commitment levels displayed by American Airlines. Clearly, there is nothing American about your airlines anymore. 5) Then, I was told bags will arrive at carousel 6 and they arrived at carousel 7 instead. Ground staff in baggage claim area didn’t even have a clue that my flight was cancelled. When I asked about where was my bag, I gave him my bag ticket and he was said “what was texture of your bag, what color was your bag”? What sort of ridiculous questions were they? 7) Now, I had to skip my whole day at work. Horrible!",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cedar Rapids to Newark via Chicago,June 2018,2,2,2,2,1,1,no

American Airlines,1,Terry Gilliam,11th June 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Jacksonville to New York via Charlotte. Sleeping at CLT: How a flight crew laid waste our $4105.29 AA Vacation family weekend in New York. First, when I wrote my review of our AA Vacations Westin La Paloma trip in April, I didn't think that experience could be worsted (opposite of bested), so I didn't expect to be writing about another superlatively bad AA Vacation again, at least not so soon. I was wrong. The moral of this story is if you value the welfare of your family, your time and your money, don't rely on AA Vacations. But I've gotten ahead of myself. Here's our story. Things went beautifully on the first leg of what was to have been a fun family weekend in NY to celebrate the end of our son's school year. We sped through TSA pre, were greeted courteously at the gate and took our assigned seats in first class on AA1937. After a pleasant short flight to Charlotte, we connected to AA1981 bound for LaGuardia. When that flight didn't push away on time, the captain announced from the flight deck that a ""minor technical issue"" would hold us up briefly. I followed a running text stream of delay notices from AA on my phone. Then I received the dreaded notice of cancellation. Oddly, the flight crew were still telling us that the “technical issue” was in the process of being fixed. Specifically, the pilot advised that the copilot had flown too many hours to legally make the trip to NY and AA was on the hunt for a replacement. When I told the cabin attendant that the flight had been cancelled, she passed the news to the captain who, nonplussed, announced that ""apparently American Airlines notifies passengers of cancellations before telling its crew."" We were advised to deplane and come back at 7:00 a.m. the following day. I immediately called AA Vacations who had booked as part of our package non-refundable tickets for activities and events on Saturday. I got a terrific agent named Kristen who nimbly booked us on a flight to Newark. She even kept our first-class status! All we had to do was run the mile from the end of terminal C to the end of terminal B before the flight's scheduled 10:00 departure. We needn't have run. The flight to Newark was delayed due to a mechanical. First 11:00, then 12:00, then vouchers to Starbucks, then 1:00, then first class boarded, then we were told to deplane, then 2:00; and then it was cancelled. The gate agent, a terrific woman with a superman pin affixed to her purse, explained sincerely sympathetically that because NASCAR was in town there were no hotel rooms left in Charlotte. Like Tom Hanks in The Terminal we were to live in the airport for the night. No options. We dragged ourselves back to gate C19, the assigned departure gate for AA9200, boarding at 6:30 a.m. on Saturday. We were heartened to see an airplane already parked there. With nothing to eat, no place to sleep and no cardboard boxes, we were all newly sympathetic to street people. We put as cheerful a face on the five hour night as we could. When boarding time came, we didn't board. The plane that had been sitting at gate C19, on which we had hung the night's hopes was ""the wrong size."" Yes, the gate agent said he had been given an airplane ""the wrong size"" for the number of passengers booked. I could feel the crowd of passengers working itself into a mob. Since most like us had been bumped from the CLT/LGA and CLT/EWR flights the night before, I could well sympathize.",,Family Leisure,Business Class,Jacksonville to New York via Charlotte,May 2018,4,3,2,,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,Angie Wall,11th June 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I purchased tickets Mar. 17 which had us flying out of PDX and arriving in Cozumel the same day. In Sept. 17, I received an email that AA changed our reservations. It seemed fine since it was a shorter travel time than the original tickets. The a.m. of the flight we arrived to check in at PDX, and during the self-check in, we got a priority slip. We took it to the ticket counter and learned that when AA changed our flights, they did not allow their own “mandatory” 50 minutes for the connection flight. As such, they refused to allow us to catch our connection from DFW to CZM. Keep in mind that this was their mandatory layover time and they made the change that didn’t conform to it! AA was unable to locate a flight that would get us into Cozumel the same day, so we were forced to incur an overnight layover at DFW. To add insult to injury, each leg of each flight they were challenged to allow me and my fiancé sit together. We would have to pay at the ticket gate to move seats. Um, we purchased our tickets at the same time, is it too far of a stretch to consider we might want to sit together! So, for four flights we had to take extra time to “sweet talk” the gate agent into letting us sit together. Unbelievable! Due to the layover resulting from AA’s error, we were forced to incur additional hotel and meal costs, spend time rearranging transfers, contacting the hotel, etc., lost an entire day of vacation time/pay, lost our all-inclusive charges and hotel charge from the hotel in Cozumel, stressed out having to pick up the pieces because of AA’s mistake, and now I’m getting the pleasure of fighting with AA since they are only offering is a $250 flight voucher for each of us. That doesn’t come close to compensating for the time, money, and trouble they caused. And actually, at this point, I wish I were fighting with them. They’ve gone incommunicado. Won’t call when they say they will, won’t return calls. and, who would want vouchers from this joke of an airline? The only silver lining was the accommodating flight attendants.

She looked us up and proceeded to become incredibly rude and told us that we had to empty our carry ons and try to cram everything into our backpacks and throw away our brand new carry-on luggage, or pay $210 to check them. After making the announcement that they would check them complementary. She was not helpful, made my daughter cry because we had to choose if what personal items to keep or throw away.

The FA kept hitting my shoulder all night long as she was walking back and forth down the aisle. I asked if they had a self service cart with juice/water and snacks in the back galley like most civilized airlines do and the told me it was not the case on this flight.

They were just being lazy and didn’t want to provide customer service. I had to wait until I got to Charlotte to reschedule my flight, because of their delay in Montego Bay. I’m 12th in line on standby and have been waiting at the airport for just the hopes of getting a flight. Here I am 8 hours later, stuck in Charlotte. Waiting for the promise of a standby flight, and if I don’t make it onto this flight, I’m stuck here all night. Customer service was the worst experience of my life, and I’m not being overly dramatic. The manager at Charlotte seemed to just direct people away.

After going to the new location and seating there for about 45 minutes. We were told that our gate had changed back to the gate we were originally at. Finally we get to board the plane around 8:45. The pilot comes over the intercom and says ""please take your seats we only have 6 minutes before our crew times out. At this time the fuel truck had just pulled up. After about 10 minutes. The pilot comes back on the intercom and tells us that the crew has times out and that they were not going to be able to fly us to Denver. So the pilots exit the plane. 10 minutes later the flight attendant come on and say ""we have a new fight crew on the way and we will be leaving as soon as they get here"". 45 minutes to an hour later after sitting on the plane she comes back on only to tell us that there was no new crew and we needed to get off the plane. Now it's around 11:00-11:30. After about an hour of sitting at the gate waiting to hear of any updates. They tell us there's a new fight crew is coming and we would be leaving as soon as they arrived and do there pre-flight checks. So around 12:15 or so the new crew starts to arrive. First 1 pilot, 20 minutes later another pilot, 20 later the engineer comes. I guess. They tell us we will be taking off shortly. Around 1:15 a.m or so. They tell us the the flight attendants have now timed out and our flight would be canceled. It's funny now but not really. They then tell us that we have to go back to the other gate to rebook our flights out. Luckily for us we knew the number to call for rebooking. So we were able to get on the next flight out at 6:45 Tuesday morning. My wife tells me today that they gave her a $100 voucher. Not only did they know they were going to have to cancel the flight but they were dishonest and didn't have to decency to tell us the truth. I have not received anything for them nor do I care to.

Overall, I was very pleased with the flights. American's 800-number agents were helpful and friendly; the website was easy to navigate for making reservations; transfers between international and domestic American flights at PHL are easy via an airside shuttle bus or a pleasant 15-minute airside walk. Although older, the Boeing 767 worked well for me: I liked the 2-3-2 seating in Economy, legroom was adequate, seats were reasonably padded, the lavatory had just enough room, and with only around 200 passengers, boarding and deplaning were fairly quick. In Economy, there is no individual flight entertainment. Cabin crew on both flights were attentive and amiable. Check-in at BUD was reasonably quick because American had 4 or 5 counter positions open for this one flight at least two and a half hours in advance.

Seats generally more comfortable than Delta but no TV, no 110 outlets in our AA flight which means we can’t even watch a movie on our computer for nearly five hour flight. Really? The most annoying thing about American Airlines is they constantly change the time and sometimes the route of the trips. Recently booked RSW to Paris for upcoming September trip and they have already changed the time making it very inconvenient. Our last trip from Vail to RSW had changed with 3 hours of layover in Dallas from 1 hour.

American Airlines,2,W Hearne,7th June 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Dallas to Oklahoma City. Normally I don’t have problems with AA but after a recent flight cancellation for the second part of my journey, I am very disappointed with the lack of action on AA’s part. My flight which was on a Sunday night was delayed for about 1.5-2 hours at which point it was canceled due to “maintenance issues.” I called AA to reschedule a flight and also went to the customer service desk. I had a flight for work the following morning at 10:30 so I really need to get back. I asked if I could be put on another flight, switched airlines, flown out somewhere else and come from another place, get a rental car, or anything that would allow me to make my flight the next morning. They said there is nothing I can do but I can go online and get a reimbursement which should be up to $120. I ended up having to rent a car and drive from DFW to OKC which cost me about $260. I have tried to be reimbursed for this cost but the best I got was a $100 voucher that has to be used within a year. The problem is very few flights cost $100 so this forces me to fly AA again within the year and have to pay them more out of my pocket so this is in no way a reimbursement but a way for them to secure my future business. Additionally the refund for my flight was $79. I feel like I did everything I could possibly do on my part to remedy the situation and felt very helpless. I am very disappointed with AA’s effort on this and I will likely turn to other airlines in the future. The next flight I could have flown on was at 4:50 the following night and AA never offered to put me in a hotel so I would have just had to stay in the airport or pay for a hotel anyways.

I was traveling from Myrtle Beach to Detroit with my wife and 8-month old daughter. Our original flight plan involved a 1-hour layover in DC. After boarding in Myrtle Beach we were instructed there was a weather delay and we were taken off the plane. After waiting 45+ minutes in line at the gate, and being refused help from the neighboring American Airlines gate, we were rebooked for a 1-hour layover in Charlotte. When that flight was also delayed I expressed concern at the gate because we may not make the connector in Charlotte. The employee was disinterested in helping us find a backup plan in case this occurred. When we arrived in Charlotte we had no chance of making the connector. The employee in Myrtle Beach knew full well that we would not make this connector but sent us onto the plane anyway. After waiting 90+ minutes to speak to customer service in Charlotte we were rebooked to travel to Chicago, then to Toledo.

Once everyone was on the plane the pilot announced that we were gonna load on more people who’s flight had been cancelled earlier in the day and that this would make us at least an hour late. Once in air the food was horrendous and inedible and that’s coming from someone who never complains about food. Apart from that the bathroom was extremely untidy with sticky toilet seats. When we landed we were once again waiting and were stuck on the runway for approximately 50 minutes. This all resulted in us being over 2 hours late.

Twice out of all of these, the original projected delay wasn’t even long enough and as I type this I have waited an additional 15 minutes past the delay. I have experienced one outstanding flight attendant on these flights, the rest we sub-par. AA has little to no entertainment, rabbit food for snacks (not literally), and worst of all, because it saves the airlines a little money, they book absurd amounts of standby passengers (22 on this flight).

I purchased a ticket through STA travel more than a month in advance from Sydney to Santa Fe round ticket, including my Advantage Number, which I have had for several years. For some reason, even if for some flights I was located at the back of the aircraft, I was placed in all flights to board on group 8 (the group after the very low priority group, even though I had a 3-leg flight). This was a problem on the way back from Dallas to Los Angeles, when they run out of overhead compartments and tried to make me check my carry on all the way to Sydney (they did not offer valet bag checking). I tried explaining that I had a 6 hours layover in LA and then a very long flight to Sydney, and that I needed my carry on (get very cold on places, and was going to arrive to winter in Sydney), and that I did not understand how the system, knowing that I had a long flight ahead would place me in the last boarding group. After a very unpleasant moment with very unfriendly personnel at the Dallas airport, I was able to bring my carry on in some extra spaces available. Additionally, even I had purchased the ticket earlier, the system would not let me pick seats in one of the flights, so I had to travel in the mid seat, next to the bathroom.

Once we board new flight, we sat for 3 hours because of thunderstorms. American Airlines boarded us knowing this storm was here. A storm doesn’t just show up without warning. So 3 hours on tarmac and then 6 hours for flight. A total of 9 hours we were on this plane. The head flight attendant was a jerk (older male). Didn’t smile not one single time and was very rude to some older folks who got up to use bathroom when seatbelt sign came on because of turbulence. Flight attendants were only at row 10 when they ran out of food you can purchase. And to be offered something to drink only once to folks who have been on a plane 9 hours is just pathetic. Never again American Airlines. You could really tell this company doesn’t care much about the value of your money. They figure people are going to buy airline tickets no matter what so there is no need to earn your business.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Daytona via Charlotte,May 2018,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

American Airlines,1,J Pace,2nd June 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Cincinnati to Fort Walton Beach. I chose to fly American Airlines because they had a flight leaving about an hour earlier than Delta. Boy was that about the biggest mistake ever. So the actual flying experience wasn’t bad at all. The problem came when my arriving flight into Charlotte, NC to catch a connection was delayed to the gate due to weather. Which was fine, we can’t control the weather. The delay also delayed my connecting flight to Fort Walton Beach. So I was still able to catch my connection. That’s fantastic. Absolutely it was. So I ask the boarding agent if there was a chance that my checked bag wouldn’t get transferred in time to the connecting flight. She said that it’s very possible that it won’t make it in time. So I said that’s ok I’ll work around picking up my bag the next day. And the next day (today) is where the problem started. I show up at 6am and there’s no one at the baggage claim office, no customer service representative to be found. I talked to the ladies at the ticket counter twice and they told me someone be down to help. So I’m there 3 hours before someone opens the door and it takes 2 minutes to get my bag. Why did it take 3 hours? The monitors show when they have flights departing and arriving. There was plenty of time between to accommodate the 2 minutes it took me to get my bag. My biggest complaint is with customer service. Everything else was as good as it could be.",,Business,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Fort Walton Beach,June 2018,3,3,,,1,3,yes

My 5:00 a.m. flight to Charlotte was delayed a little over an hour, because the AC was broken, after we were told it would take 10-15 min to fix. We then missed our connecting flight from Charlotte to New Orleans and the next one was almost 4 hours later. We had paid extra to have seats next to each other and in preferred seating and when we got off the plane and had to get new boarding passes we were basically told too bad nothing they can do about it. When we arrived to New Orleans everything in my bag was damp and all my clothes had to be put in the dryer. But i had nothing in my bag that could've leaked. On the way back, we had a layover in Chicago of an hour until our connecting flight to Newark. 40 minutes before our flight we found out we're delayed an hour and a half.

On the way here the service was great, 0 delays. Granted that was Memorial Day. Flying home this morning was a pain in the ass. It started arriving to LaGuardia airport this morning with staff who seemed to not be knowledgeable of what they were doing and told me all other flights were booked (not true). My flight was supposed to leave at 1030am from LaGuardia, which turned into 1130am then to 12.50pm mind you I had been sitting st the airport since 8.30am. The only flights left to my final destination was a 10.30pm flight out of DFW meaning I would sit in DFW for 6-7 hours or more depending on delays. Turning a 6 hour travel day into a 17 hour flight day. Additionally I would have missed that flight if I would have not gotten up to go to the restroom and so happen to look at the monitor to see that the gate had changed. No communication what so ever about the gate change. We did not depart to almost 1:15pm - mind you they gave us 0 information about the whereabouts or why our flight was delayed for nearly 2 hours. Finally we made it to Dallas 3.5 hours later. At this point I was tired and irritable. Thank you to the kind woman at DFW working for AA, who got me on a flight sooner than 1030pm, she was patient, kind and emphatic. She made sure I still had my first class seat and all. She turned a very long day into a better one.

Which I can live with and understand except that my girlfriend and I were sitting in the airport over 5 hours watching other planes takeoff. So we sat patiently for 5 hours and finally began boarding at 11:00 pm. American boarded the entire plane and was ready for take off, but then decided to cancel the flight at 11:47 which was after the rescheduled departure time. Then the earliest flight they could get me was in 24 hrs basically causing me to cancel my entire 3 day trip.

American Airlines,5,M Winston,31st May 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Punta Cana to Seattle via Miami. Overall the customer service is pretty good with American Airlines. Everyone was friendly to us. My frustration lies with a delay on the ground. It was only announced that the flight would be delayed once we landed because we didn't have a gate, and customs was backed up. We sat waiting for over an hour, returning from an international flight, we still had customs, and another round of security to go through before reaching our connecting flight. We ended up missing our connection, we were rerouted back to the entrance without being told where we were going, when we still had 15min to catch our plane, had they called and had it wait for us, we could have caught it. Instead we were forced to rebook another flight. Communication wasn't great at this point. We thought we were getting rebooked for another route that would get us home only an hour after our original flight, and one flight, as we had originally booked. But we were handed two tickets (rather than the one) on a flight that didn't depart till the next day. They claimed that they don't comp hotels if it's due to weather, the reason for the delay, but no one ever said that we were delayed due to weather. She said I couldn't talk to a manager and wouldn't make eye contact with me after I complained. I would now arrive home a day later, and have to pay $150 more than I originally planned to pay for a cab and hotel. The lady who helped us the next morning was really friendly and didn't charge us to check our bags even though we didn't have receipts for the original payment. She also adjusted our seats so we could sit together. Overall service on the plane was good. Maybe when booking connecting international flights the airlines should require a minimum time in between to eliminate the stress of connecting flights in between.

American Airlines,2,H Christie,29th May 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Charlotte to Chicago. I'm writing this in hopes someone that gets paid too much at American Airlines finally makes some changes to improve how they operate. I was the typical customer making a connection that was predetermined by the airline. Using decades of history and algorithms to maximize efficiency for the company and yet getting customer where they need to be you would think this would not be an issue anymore. We got off one plane and literally ran across the airport getting to our terminal 10 minutes before it was scheduled to leave at which they told us ""we knew you were checked in and coming but we can't let you in 10 minutes before flight"". At that time we gave them a confused look as it was 10 minutes before the flight. So you see where I am going with this and why I will never fly with them again but the story gets better from there. We go down to customer service as instructed by the gate attendant to see if we can get on the next flight that is 3 hours delay which sounds good at first but not when you have family waiting for you that drove over 4 hours to pick you up. We had asked if they could do anything from free tickets to a cup of coffee of which they denied saying this happens all the time and it is not our fault. And now for the icing on the cake, they were not sure where our luggage was and after 5 minutes they said it made it on to our original flight. Crazy how that works out right? Now after if spins around the turn style for 45 minutes and hopefully nobody takes it they said it will be picked up and then placed in an office for us to pick up. Long story short, we fly often enough that I am 100% confident saying that American Airlines has some major room to improve so please use another even if you pay a few $ more.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Chicago,January 2018,3,3,2,2,1,3,no

This is the third time in a row I have flown with American Airlines and they delayed the departure time by more than 2 hours, not because of the weather but because of “mechanical issues”. Last time it was delayed a total of 5 hours. It is extremely frustrating to be stranded in an airport for such an excessive amount of time because the airline repeatedly has issues with their planes.

No meal is provided for a 6-hour flight and the purchase options are very poor and not clear (it differs based on time and route). The in-flight entertainment on the contrary was a surprise - it worked well and the movie selection was quite wide. What I really don't understand is the seating allocation policy of the airline - we used it twice, always used the recommended kiosk self-check in option and in both cases we got a boarding pass with no assigned seats along with a note ""please see agent at the gate"", which we did and we got the boarding pass from him.

American Airlines,1,Jackeline Voigt,28th May 2018,"❌ Not Verified | I was very dissatisfied with American Airlines during my last trip. My flight from Colorado Springs to Shreveport was weather delayed in Colorado Springs. I understand that these things happen. But when arriving in Dallas to switch connections to go to Shreveport, I rushed to my gate and found that my plane was still at the gate. But they would not allow me to board. The flight departed earlier than scheduled with me watching it leave the gate without me. I was very disappointed that American did not notify the gate that a passenger was a few minutes late due to their late arrival of a connecting flight. It is not like it was an hour or more, it was 10 minutes at most. Other airlines that I have flown have notified other gates of this happening, especially if it is weather related. I am a frequent flier on many airlines, and it has been done for me before. Due to this, I was under a lot of stress. My main reason for going to Shreveport was to meet my daughter and get her back home to Florida. I went to flight services in Dallas, and they were not any help at all. No monetary help or voucher for a hotel overnight either. They attempted to help me with getting my checked bag that arrived with me in Dallas, but the employee from my arriving gate had already gone home because it was after 9. Because of this, my bag left the next morning to go to Shreveport, even though I was going to be leaving from Dallas later in the day to go back to Florida with my daughter, who was arriving from Shreveport. To make things worse, I had to wait 6 days to get my suitcase returned to me in Florida. After checking with American baggage services, I found out that it stayed in Shreveport for 5 days sitting there. My bag had important business materials inside. Needless to say, unless it is a last resort, I will not be flying American Airlines again.

We were saddened to return home from such a beautiful place filled with very nice people. We arrived at the airport early, at 10:00am. When we were trying to process our boarding passes, the woman working at the counter was extremely rude for some reason. Her and her colleague were rolling their eyes and seemed to be annoyed that I was speaking English with my American wife. They made derogatory comments towards my wife being American. She became irate when I was explaining to her that I was a Permanent U.S Resident. I speak fluent Spanish and she ignored me and said she had to call immigration in Phoenix? She left and returned to process my wife's pass. I asked her if I could explain to whomever she was trying to contact my status. I told her that I obviously boarded a plane to get here, and that I needed to get home. I was polite the entire time and she was rude to my wife for no reason. She then said. I can't let you board. No explanation what so ever. My heart sank. I maintain composure and asked her to let me talk to her imaginary friend who she supposedly called at Customs. She just smiled and said Sorry. I asked her to have my Wife board and then I would need a flight rearranged to my native Sonora so I could contact someone at the Consulate. She faked smiled again and said sorry, we can't do anything. She then said I would have to purchase another ticket. I promptly bought a ticket on AeroMexico and had no issues getting to Hermosillo, except for the fact that my Wife flew alone, She had to explain to my two kids that I was in Mexico because some AA rep at the desk was discriminating me because I am Mexican and live in the US, Not to mention I had to fly to Mexico City, get delayed to thunderstorms there 2 hours, finally flew to Sonora at Midnight. I arrived in Hermosillo at 2 in the morning. Somehow I got to the Nogales border, thanks to a friend. Crossed the U.S Border at 7am with no issues. I had to be at work.

After reading many recent poor reviews of American Airlines, we were concerned that we too might have a flight of horrors. However, our experience was the opposite of most of the recent reviews.

The flight attendants offered reasonably friendly in-flight service throughout. There was more food and drink on offer during the flight than anyone could have wanted (dinner, snacks, more snacks, breakfast). The lie flat seat, with Casper bedding, while a tad firm for some most likely, provided the opportunity to get a short nights sleep.

American Airlines,2,P Walker,23rd May 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | First I'd like to start out saying that 20 years ago, I had the exact same result as I did this past weekend and swore I would never fly American Airlines again. I was returning to Houston from Salt Lake City, I had to go thru Dallas for a connecting flight. My flight in Salt Lake City was delayed due to weather issues originally. I knew I was going to miss my connecting flight in Dallas, once I heard of the delay and got up in line (a long one at that) to be told to call the 1-800 number to get done faster. When I spoke with customer service, they told me ""I'll be fine as the plane is supposed to board at 4.08 pm"" and I was like ""Oh great, ok, I don't need anything else then"". Not realizing the time when I hung up the phone, it was 4.12 pm and there was no plane at the gate. So, we (as in other passengers and myself) were getting updates saying we were boarding every 10 minutes. Come to find out, because of the weather, the plane that was trying to land was re-routed to Pocatello, ID because they needed to re-fuel. The plane finally landed around 6.15 pm, only to learn that our flight was now cancelled due to the fact that the flight crew had met their hours for the day and couldn't fly anymore. So, at that point we were all stranded, most other flights were full and I for sure was going to miss my connecting flight. Supposedly, because this was a weather issue, American Airlines would not put any of the passengers up in hotels, etc. However, it was no longer a weather issue as other planes were flying in and taking off just fine in Salt Lake City. This was clearly, American Airlines crew that couldn't fly anymore. So our flight was delayed until 7.00 am the next morning. So we return to the airport, did not receive any updates on our flight and hoping for the best I spoke with the gentleman at the gate and asked him to help me find a connecting flight to Houston. He told me, they were all full and to try once I get to Dallas to get on stand by. I finally make it to Dallas, I get off the plane and go directly to the ticket counter at the gate that I just walked out of. I explained that I needed a connecting flight to Houston. At first, the lady couldn't find me in the system (even though I just walked off the plane) and then once she did find me in the system, she said she had record of me landing the night before in Dallas. At this point, I was boiling mad, because clearly she just saw me walk off the plane. Then she said, there was a flight later in the evening that she could get me on. I explained it was my daughter's graduation party that evening and I needed to be home before 8.00 pm that night. So, she handed me a boarding pass and told me to go try and get on Stand by on another flight. Went to that gate only to find out there was a lot of other people standing by and probably would not make that flight and at that point I went and got a rental car so I can be home in time for my daughter's graduation party, that I was hosting. My biggest disappoint in the airline is that not one American Airlines employee even said ""I'm sorry!"" When you work in customer service and have an upset customer, you should always acknowledge that you understand the frustration and you are working hard to get us home or to resolve the issue. This never happened with American Airlines. I was met with one rude person after the other. It wasn't just me.

Well I go to get on the plane and they won't let me on without paying 50 dollars. Why didn't the lady who printed my ticket tell me? Why didn't they announce it for all of section 9 until right before the flight was boarding, when I would have had time to go back to the baggage claim and only have to pay 25 dollars instead of 50 now for a carry on size.

American Airlines,1,Tyler Church,22nd May 2018,"❌ Not Verified | I had a trip planned to Puerto Rico for my birthday. I Arrived at 5am to DCA To a weather delay (understandable) Couple hours passed and when we went to board the plane a new maintenance issue caused a 20 minute delay. For the next 5 hours they kept extending the maintenance delay every 30 minutes. There was almost no communication with each attendant telling different answers. The app was also extremely unhelpful. After waiting in airport for 12 hours, they finally cancelled the flight as never going to leave the terminal. I called customer service for a refund and they said that they might be able to reschedule. Another attendant the said that I should still cancel and get refund since the airline was backed up and going to be prone to more weather delays and maintenance issues. (Every person had different answers) I asked if I could just get a voucher to help make up for lost hotel, stress, etc. Two reps said yes but another said that they couldn’t. Long story short they cancelled my flight then left me out to dry with just the refund of my ticket and no additional vouchers. I am still out a large sum for the trip not including lost vacation days and stress. This was the worst customer experience of my life. I was a loyalty program member with an AA credit card and was Still treated this way by staff and the company even after filing a complaint. “...They told me (paraphrase) that it was not their obligation and that I should give them a second chance...” I was lied to and lost an entire vacation to their terrible maintenance and business practices and would urge no person to use AA as their preferred loyalty program.

American will nickle and dime you for everything possible. I spent over 50 USD just to fly with 1 checked bag round trip. Next was the seat charge, any seat with a few extra inches of leg room will cost you a minimum of 34 extra each way! Once onboard is their in flight snacks, they start at 9 and increase significantly. On this particular trip they switched the gate and terminal 4 times within the span of 2 hours before the flight which made for some long walks. Surprisingly our flight arrived 30 min early but we had to wait the entire 30 minutes on the plane at the gate before we could deboard because they couldn’t find an employee to move the sky bridge into place!

The soonest they could get me on a flight was the next day with 2 (two) stops. I would miss my wedding so did not take it. My complaint is, when they cancelled the flight, only one employee was at the gate trying to reschedule everyone's flights. The American gate next to it, had 5 employees, talking, laughing, not doing anything. I went over to them and asked if they could help me. I had been in my line for 30 minutes and the employee had only gotten through 2 people! So you can imagine the anger of everyone in line! The 5 employees at the adjacent gate said they couldn't help and really didn't seem to care enough to walk over to our gate to help that 1 lone employee. I found that to be so incompetent for this or any airlines. Worst part for me was, my daughter was gong to the same wedding, also flew out from the same airport, same time, with JetBlue. And her ticket cost half as much as mine! So my daughter, poor thing, landed in Boston and spent the weekend by herself. No excuses.

Safe to say I will never be flying with American Airlines because they’re 2 for 2 for long delays. This has caused extreme problems and anxiety due to work meetings. What a joke.

American Airlines,8,Eelco van den Heuvel,15th May 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Nashville via Charlotte/Philadelphia. Though American Airlines doesn't get much credit on this site, our trip worked out fine. We had 4 flights with them and all were bang on time. I like the fact that AA flies in Frankfurt from the much quieter terminal 2. We were recevied by very friendly groundstaff and had our bag dropped within 15 mins. AA holds firmly to the boarding-by-group system which I like very much. The flight from Frankfurt to Charlotte was good: a rather tasty meal and plenty of drinks and snacks. We only had 1,5 hour connection time to Nashville, so we were a bit weary about that, because you have tot go through immigration and collect your bag again and go through security again, but is was okay. Airport staff is ready tot take your bag immediately from you after immigration so you can rush through security. By the time we got tot the gate boarding began and again we had a very punctual departure for Nashville. Small snack and a drink on this one-hour flight was enough. Checking in in Nashville for our inbound flight again was a breeze. Again very friendly ground staff (we've experienced different before!) and within 10 mins we were at the gate. Flight from Nashville to Philadelphia took only 1,5 hours in stead of the advertised 2 hours and 10 mins and that was good since we had only 50 mins connecting time in Philadelphia. Still quite a run because we arrived at B10 and our plane to Frankfurt was at the furthest gate (A26). By the time we arrived we were almost the last ones to board. Our son wasn't assigned a seat in Nashville but his boarding pass with seat was ready in Philadelphia. Four the fourth time a very punctual departure. Again a meal, rather bland but okay and plenty of drinks and snacks. Breakfast -well, sort of- an hour for landing. 280 films and games to choose from. Crew over all not very friendly but never unfriendly. In less than seven hours to Frankfurt, landed almost an hour earlier. All in all a very good experience.

American Airlines,2,Mary Ann G Jenkins,15th May 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Charlotte to London Heathrow. I was so disappointed in my experience with American Airlines. I just returned from a flight on Delta and it was a far and away better experience than with AA. The difference was night and day. On both my flights to and from London, the crew never cracked a smile, never had a welcoming word, never answered a request for service with an agreeable attitude. They obviously didn't want to be dealing with the customers and were, at times, even sarcastic to their passengers. My touch screen didn't work but I didn't dare ask the attendants for assistance and get a snarky answer. The food was marginal, at best, but it was the attitude of the crew that spoiled the travel. The gate crew on Charlotte even mocked the passengers from the preceding flight within hearing of the waiting passengers. No wonder my flights were not full. Unless I have to choose American Airlines in the future, I will be flying anyone else.

The only other flight to Nashville from Dallas was at 4:30 in the afternoon (original flight was scheduled to leave at 12:30). So I spent 4 hours sitting around in Colorado Springs waiting on the ""delayed flight"", I spent 3 hours waiting around in Dallas because of my ""delayed"" flight.

American Airlines,1,K Willis,10th May 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Pittsburgh to Chicago O’Hare. I fly weekly for work as a business traveler between Buffalo, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh. I live in Chicago. As you can imagine, this leaves little flexibility in my schedule. When I do have a change in my schedule that allows me to get home faster, I try to fly standby or change my flight. Every time I am told there is a $200 or $75 change fee that cannot be waived. Considering I have been traveling every single week for 6 months now, it is extremely frustrating that I am not able to switch flights without paying an unreasonable fee when there are open seats on a flight. I have already paid for my original ticket. United has been able to make this change for me with no problem. If you are a business traveler, do not fly American.

American Airlines,1,K Irving,10th May 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Atlanta. This American flight had tons of issues. Most concerning was that the aircraft came out of maintenance following service with problems remaining. The plane came out of LAX maintenance with non-functional entertainment systems, about which the crew were never notified. Oddly, even though the plane was sitting at LAX, the plane was nearly 2 hours late to the gate. This was a serious problem, because the pilots were set to time out 1 hour and 18 minutes after the original departure time. A series of blunders followed, including a broken fuel pump, which slowed refueling. We ultimately left with under a minute remaining before the pilots would have timed out.

We had 2 flights to Hawaii both 6 hours long. From Philly to the Big Island there were no TV’s on either flight. One little screen in the aisle that dropped down and played one stupid movie. Two passes of the beverage cart with a handful of pretzels. American Airlines need to put planes into service that have individual TV’s for flights that are longer than 3 hours.

Free booze the duration of the flight, full dinner served with real plates and silverware that was complimentary, and pillows and blankets, and wait for it! TV’s for every single passenger! American Airlines needs to see how to keep their passengers happy buy making their flight more comfortable and not dumping all their money into Philadelphia Terminal B.

Expect to hear excuses like overbooking, maintenance, or insufficient staff availability. Expect to be greeted by rude customer service agents when you try to make other arrangements. Expect a hard fight to receive any form of compensation for the inconveniences that they inflict on you. Expect to talk to numerous agents on the phone and at the airport, wasting hours of your time, until you eventually (if you have the patience to see it through) find that one person who will take five seconds of their time to help you. Expect some staff members to simply ignore you when you ask them questions. Expect that you will not make it to your destination at the time printed on your ticket. Even if you do make it onto a plane eventually (likely not the one you originally booked) expect it to be very cramped and uncomfortable. I have flown American Airlines numerous times over the past few years. Every time is a struggle. At Boston Logan Airport and Philadelphia Airport especially, the staff simply refuse to help when something goes wrong. They will instead resort to silence or walk away when you try to ask a question. At American Airlines, your problems are not their concern. Getting you to your destination on time is not their concern. Your comfort is not their concern. Their only concern is your money, which they will hold onto even when they fail to provide the services you paid them for.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Boston,February 2018,1,2,2,,1,1,no

American Airlines,1,L Fox,6th May 2018,"❌ Not Verified | Miami to Toronto. I will never fly American Airlines again. Our flight was cancelled on Sunday April 15 to Toronto due to bad weather. I understand why the flight needed to be cancelled, however we were told by American Airlines staff that our luggage had been sent too Toronto on another flight. Which made absolutely no sense to me. We did not have a return flight until Wednesday which meant we had 3 days without any clothing/personal products. I requested some sort of financial compensation because of this and was told that baggage does not handle compensation and to go upstairs and put in a request. When we were upstairs we were told to get into 3 different line ups once we were finally able to speak to someone we were told that they did not provide compensation (I understand about the flight cancellation but believed they should not have sent our suitcases ahead without us). I asked to speak to the supervisor and she told me that they have nothing to do with baggage and if I wanted financial compensation I needed to go back to baggage. She then checked our baggage tags and said our luggage was still in the airport. We then went back downstairs and spoke to someone who was in the luggage area, he was extremely rude so I asked to speak to his supervisor and he refused to call one. His coworker could tell I was becoming visibly upset so called a supervisor. She then left. We waited for approximately 10 minutes and ask the employee who had refused to call a supervisor if they were coming and he said ""no, if you want to speak to a supervisor you need to stand in that line over there"". So we went and stood in line again . Once through the line I asked to speak to the supervisor and told her that we were told upstairs that our suitcases were still in the airport. She said they maybe here but we could not have them and they were going to be forwarded to Toronto. I then asked for financial compensation for toiletries, clothing etc and she told me I had to go back upstairs to Customer Assistance that they do not handle compensation. I then lost my temper because this was the third time I was told to go to a different spot. Every single staff I dealt with at American Airlines that day was extremely rude and continuously told us we were in the wrong line up, department or it wasn't something they handled. We did eventually get our luggage back the next day but I believe it was largely do to the fact that I was persistent and lost my temper. I would like to mention that there was one staff member in customer assistance who was pleasant to deal with when my mother and I went to confirm our seat on Tuesday April 17th - he needs need to find another airline to work for, and is far too nice of a person to be working with such rude, awful, unhelpful people.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Toronto,April 2018,2,2,1,,1,1,no

The flight was scheduled to start boarding at 11:45 at C29. I checked the board around 11 to confirm and still had this gate. Around 12 after the flight had not been called I wondered if I was at the right gate. I pulled up flight on my phone which said flight had been changed to C28 which was in hearing range of where I was sitting. The flight was never announced and I had missed it. When I went to counter, the agent proceeded to tell me that it was my responsibility to find out which gate and they did not have to announce it. I informed the agent I had checked the board within the hour and the gate was listed as C29. He stated everyone was already there and so he didn’t have to announce. However me and my 4 kids were less than 15 yards away and we were not on board. Even the “customer care” department who I spoke with on the phone had this not my problem attitude. If I had not been so close to the terminal from which my flight departed I would not have a problem.

Then, got to the airport on 2 hours of sleep, only to be told after waiting in line for 2 more hours that our 8 am flight wasn’t available. Fast forward to our last flight from Toronto to Regina, and they didn’t even put us on our last flight, and didn’t confirm the rescheduled flight, so we were stranded, yet again. We barely managed to get someone to get us a hotel and food vouchers for the night, after another hour of searching through the airport. After we got home, we emailed customer support to only get compensated a couple hundred Americans airline dollars for our trouble.

We were supposed to leave at 8:10 am - after delay after delay we boarded the plane around 2:30pm after sitting in the airport for 8 hours. We got in the sky and about 2 hours into our travel. There was an announcement from the captain explaining that we have to fasten our seatbelts immediately because we would have to make an emergency landing in Fort Myers because they were low on fuel. Im not quite sure why the airplane would be low on fuel about 2 hours into the short trip! That is absolutely absurd! Shortly after that there was another announcement from one of the flight attendants stating that she knows we all have questions and she does not have the answers to in a very frantic voice putting us all In a very scared state. Im not quite sure what she meant by that because the answer was to get more fuel which seemed like an absolute lie or cover up of some sort. Once we finally landed in Fort Myers me and the 4 other people that I was with the 3 that were on the reservation with me, and a friend from another reservation demanded to get off of the plane because we felt unsafe along with some other people that wanted off of the plane. We were told that we were not allowed off of the plane. Not only were we afraid for our lives because of the low fuel incident, we felt as though we were being held hostage. The captain and other workers were extremely rude to us and made us feel very uneasy! They even told us we are on our own when we got off of the plane after ripping up our tickets. After telling us that we were not allowed off of the plane and to take our seats we all demanded to get off. Finally, they let us off of the plane snatched our tickets and ripped them up. We had to pay for a rental car to get to the final destination Miami and drive for about 3 hours due to thunderstorms. We did not reach our destination until after 10:30pm. This has been a disaster! This was my first flight and not sure that I will be getting on another plane again. Our 2-3 hr flight turned into a 16.5 hour trip, more money spent on a rental, afraid for our lives, and an entire day lost! Our way home was on a Frontier airline and took us 2 hours and 5 minutes.!

When I finally got to a kiosk and proceeded to check in, I had a quick question regarding my seat assignment. There were two agents standing near me at one of the broken kiosks, talking to each other, one of whom was a manager. He said “Just one minute”. After waiting 5 minutes, I just finished without assistance. He then came over to me and said “I’m here now”. I told him “that’s ok”. He proceeded to stand next to me while I waited for my boarding pass. I was clearly aggravated, but I didn’t say anything more to him. As I proceeded to leave, he loudly and arrogantly said “ have a nice day!” On my previous flight, I was assigned to an exit row seat. I’m tall, so I asked the agent at the gate for my seat to be changed to an exit row seat, if possible (same question that I had earlier when I was checking in). She wasn’t nice either. She said “yeah, if you want to pay more”. I said that I didn’t realize that because I didn’t pay anything extra for the exit row on my departure flight. The agent asked me if I minded taking it. She said, “well, it cost more money because people want those seats”. I am happy with the seat assigned to me.

Unfortunately, tonight I decided to give AA another chance so I could accommodate a business dinner in Chicago during a layover. I arrived at the gate 20 minutes before flight time to find that my 1st class seat had been given away as an upgrade to someone else and I’d been re-booked on the first morning flight.

My best flight however was the one from Boston to New York on a transcontinental A321. I got a comfortable seat in the business-class section for this short 40-minutes-hop into JFK. But it was the captain who made this flight so special. As it was a clear and beautiful day he encouraged the passengers to look out of the window. And they actually did so. The Captain went as far as pointing out some sights en route and commenting on them. It was like flying in the 1980s when inflight entertainment on shorthaul flights was non-existent.

Due to an ice storm in Toronto, my connecting flight from Charlotte to Toronto was canceled (which I understood, and I support the airline in wanting to keep passengers safe). I admit that I was frustrated and worried because I was having trouble connecting to the CLT wi-fi to let my family know I was stranded (and I had never been stranded before), but even so, the lack of sympathy from the American Airlines staff was just staggering. The staff at the service desk talked more to each other than they did to me, and eventually handed me a scrap of paper with a 1-888 number for Travelassist and told me to go call the number. No empathy, no vouchers for food or shelter to help me along. And when I called the Travelassist number, they told me that all the hotels were booked and to call back in 2 hours to see if anything had come available (which is just as well, because I was so tired I gave up and booked a hotel through Expedia, and later found out that Expedia beat the ""distressed passenger rates"" AA secured by $15 per night!) When I got to the baggage claim to grab the bag I'd checked, it wasn't there, and when I asked the AA rep at the desk about it, he said that it could take 1-2 hours, and ""if my bag didn't show up in 2 hours, come back."" After an hour or so, my bag finally showed up. When I caught my rescheduled flight 2 days later, the AA staff at O'Hare were just as rude as the ones at CLT! I was not able to check in online for my connection, and only wanted someone to confirm whether I would be flying out that day, as I had a family member in Toronto waiting to pick me up and would have to message that person if I was delayed. When I went up to the desk at my gate, there was no-one there, but a young AA staff member was hovering nearby, so I asked him if he could help me. I was abruptly told by an AA crew member behind me that I had to wait for the gate attendants to show up. When they did, I went up to them to ask if they could help me, and was rudely told by the attendants (whose nametags were completely hidden by their scarves) to come back when they'd finished boarding the current flight. Other than the stewardess who grumpily loaned me a pen so I could complete my customs form, there wasn't a single American Airlines staff member I encountered who could be described as helpful, and none of them were kind or pleasant. I was a stranded student who had chosen AA so that I could come home from an academic conference a day early to save $350. Now, all the money I saved by choosing AA is gone because I received no vouchers, no guidance, no sympathy and no help. My first experience with American Airlines, which spanned multiple airports, showed me how rude, unhelpful and unsympathetic customer service people can be. And based on most of the other reviews on this site, I'm not alone in that discovery.

American Airlines,1,Monique Scudder,17th April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | We purchased 2 first class tickets from San Jose to Aruba. Well San Jose to Phoenix to Miami to Aruba. All American Airlines and all purchased at once. On our way there the connecting flight from Phoenix to Miami (Phoenix layover) was very tight. Just under an hour. We made it ok. On our way back the layover was actually only about 30 minutes in that same airport! Our Miami to Phoenix flight was unfortunately 15 minutes late. And we discovered upon final decent (landing) that we were already 15 minutes past boarding time for next flight by the time that our plane was touching down in Phoenix! Our stewardess let us know this is a common problem for this airport and directed us to the AA magazine so we could familiarize ourselves with the airport and see which way we need to run. We waited for the airplane door to open, ran out first (since we were first class) and ran through the Phoenix airport from our arrival gate, two terminals away to departure gate. When we got there, the door was shut, and there were 5 other people there who didn’t make it from other connecting flights besides ours. Everyone was complaining considering the plane was still right there. It didn’t leave for another 20 minutes or so but it didn’t matter. Upon getting to the customer service line, as the group of us did, there were others there complaining about the same issue. By our turn all the flights to the Bay Area for the night we’re full. We were told at this point our checked luggage was here with us in Phoenix so we could get it and take their shuttle to double tree (with a voucher) though they didn’t offer us a food voucher. Once at the carousels to pick up our luggage, we were told our luggage had actually made the flight. Then we were told we should have asked for a food voucher and we should go back. At this point we were 15 plus minutes down the airport and we’re too frustrated to go back. When getting to the airport the next morning, we were told first class was full. The plane was full and we were not even going to be sitting near each other. So much for the extra money for first class! Horrible experience and customer service. Another thing is on one of our earlier flights, we watched the luggage being literally thrown mid air from a luggage cart to conveyer belt.",,Couple Leisure,First Class,Aruba to San Jose,April 2018,1,3,1,1,1,1,no

Departed Miami on time and connected in Chicago to find out they canceled the one hour flight I booked 12 hours earlier to make it home to Rochester before the storm. Now I’ll be stuck here in Chicago for 2 days which will result in thousands of dollars in lost revenue for my business. Not to mention the checked bag they lost along the way as well.

AE was no help, was on the phone with them over 3 times to cancel the transaction and report the issue. They stated they'd cancel but that the money wouldn't be sent back to my account for up to 3 business days. And then when we were rescheduled to leave, they have maintenance issues and the flight was delayed over an hour. Our connecting flight took off 45 minutes after we were supposed to land so I brought this concern to the employee at the desk. He laughed and stated rudely ""all you Miami folks are nervous Nelly's. I need you to be patient."" And then when the flight was delayed again the worker asked another co-worker if she could help find the Miami connecting folks a different flight and she loudly stated ""I really don't want to!"" And they both laughed. Very unprofessional experience which has left me knowing to never fly American again.

But nowhere on the American website does it state that any personal item that has wheels and a handle is not considered a personal item even if the measurements are less than required. On my flight, as I was getting ready to board I was basically held hostage before I could board because my personal item had a handle and wheels and that is considered a carry-on. Not only did I pay a baggage fee, I was assessed a penalty fee for a total of $60.

American Airlines,1,Terry Gilliam,12th April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Jacksonville to Tucson via Dallas. This is a story about what happens when you are a Platinum Million Miler with American Airlines and you pay full fare for three first-class tickets for your family, booking through AAVacations and one of your family gets bumped by an air marshal. Spoiler alert: To stop you tweeting they mollify you with ""Our AA Vacations team will be able to help out with a refund once your travel is complete."" And once your travel is complete, the AAVacations team tells you they cannot issue refunds and sends you into a bureaucratic maze designed to punish you until you surrender. Here's the back story: First know that there were two marshals sitting in a 9-passenger first-class cabin on the dangerous passage between JAX and DFW. My petite wife ended up taking our displaced son's seat 20A because she was the only one who could fit into it--an unhappy way to start a $7K ""luxury vacation."" 20A is the seat opposite the aft cabin lav on a CR9 RJ900 aircraft. Her seatmate, a small elderly woman who also paid full-fare for a first-class seat, had been displaced by a second air marshal. More, so that the two air marshals could sit silently together, ever vigilant, one played poker and the other solitaire on their phones - my son and I were split up and placed as far apart as possible and still be in the same cabin. Having flown many millions of miles on many carriers, I suspected that not everyone in First had paid full fare for their ticket, so far in advance of boarding we asked the gate agent to look into the possibility of getting us back into our original seats, together three across. Subsequently, she managed to avoid my requests for updates until just before boarding when she advised that ""No one had volunteered to give up their seat"" and attempted to foist a $300 voucher on us as compensation, adding ""There's nothing else I can do."" Not true. When you do finally arrive at your vacation destination, American has managed to lose your bag. Now I understand that this happens, but how did they lose only one of the four bags we checked and why did it have to be my wife's bag? The following morning they delivered the bag to the Westin La Paloma, where we enjoyed a terrific week.

American Airlines,2,D Wallace,10th April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Akron to Birmingham via Philadelphia. Flight: 5243 March 23, 2018 from CAK to PHL First, we would like to thank the flight crew for their efforts to make a bad situation better and to resolve the unfortunate miscommunication with flight maintenance. Our understanding of the issue provided by the pilot was that there was some discrepancy with the flight maintenance log and that someone from maintenance would need to review and approve it before we could take off. The plane had been at the gate for over an hour before we boarded, and no maintenance was performed. We were informed that flight maintenance needed 30 minutes to resolve the issue, which turned into an additional 30+ plus minutes. At this point we have missed the original departure schedule but the crew was told it would be resolved in another 30 minutes and we could make up some time due to tail winds. Because of the delay sitting on the tarmac passengers were offered to deplane with the knowledge that they could not board again. Apparently, a passenger that only spoke Russian did deplane not realizing she could not return. She was very upset and in tears when she was allowed back on the plane, which, unfortunately impacted the departure time. At this point we had been on hold for more than two hours and it was clear we would miss our connecting flight from Philadelphia to Birmingham. Since there were no more flights to Birmingham that evening we were provided rooms at the Airport Wyndham hotel, comfortable at this point due to our exhaustion, but nowhere near a three-star hotel as advertised. We didn’t fly Spirit Airlines because of bad reviews, now we have one to tell regarding our experience with American Airlines. The situation seems like it could have been avoided with better communications and if flight maintenance would have done their required repairs before we boarded the flight.

American Airlines,2,W Gearan,10th April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Orlando to Kahului. Customer service training must happen or happen more frequently. I have flown many times on business trips and with my family. I have never experienced what we experienced this trip. Our flight to Florida was okay. On our way back home, we were checking in at the Orlando Airport. A AA agent told us that we had to check in our Sit & Stand stroller. We told her that it was never a problem coming and all the past times we traveled. She said that at this airport, we had no choice and had to check it in. I went to ask another AA agent. I politely said, ""Good morning Maam"" to get her attention. She looked at me and said, ""Uuuggg"", you are the second person that called me Maam today! What do you want?"" I looked at her and said, ""I'll ask someone else"". Can you imagine the things you need to carry while traveling with two children? This made it very difficult to travel with two young children to say the least. When passing through TSA, we asked what the deal was and they said, it was okay with TSA. They check and allow any type of stroller. We got up to our gate and we saw one family on the flight before us who had the same exact Sit & Stand stroller and had no questions asked and strolled right into the jet way. I asked the agent, why the family before us was allowed and why we had to check our stroller in. She stated that it must have been missed. I found that hard to believe as another family checked in a double stroller (wider and more bulky than what we had). I looked around and noticed that we were the only family without our stroller. When we got to Texas, the AA agent was so rude. We asked if our family could sit closer together. She asked for my boarding pass. Since my wife had it, I asked if I could show her a picture on my phone. She looked at me and said, ""I don't want to hold you phone. Phones are full of germs."" I didn't want her to hold my phone anyway, but what a thing to tell a guest. Phones could be full of germs, but you don't need to say that to a guest.

American Airlines,1,Terrence Cheng,9th April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Our flight was canceled because of snow-fine, no one can control the weather. The issue is in what happened after our flight was canceled. We were rebooked on a flight for the next morning, that would have taken us from NY to Boston, and then to Miami - a total of about 6 hours travel the next day. I called the 800# for AA to talk to someone about rebooking for something, anything that would get us into Miami that day, so we would not have to waste 2 entire days of our 5 day break (while also wasting hotel nights, and other things we'd planned). When I spoke to the person on the 800# she told me that there were no more flights leaving JFK, Newark, or LaGuardia, going to Miami that day. And maybe this was true for direct flights. I asked if there were any other options whatsoever, with flights going elsewhere that might then connect to Miami that day. She told me there were no other options. I asked, point blank, ""So you're telling me that no more flights are arriving in Miami for American Airlines for the rest of the day?"" She told me the only option was for this flight we had been rebooked. I then went to a counter to try to get on a standby list for an AA flight that was full, and going to Miami. Seeing a growing line of upset people, the attendant at the counter actually made an announcement that he could not help anyone who had been booked for the 6.45 canceled flight. I spoke to him anyway. I, again, asked if there were any options at all that would get us to Miami via American. He told me he was just too busy to help me. I'd like you to meditate on this for a moment: an AA service representative told me that he was too busy to help me, a customer whose paid flight on American Airlines for himself and his family to go away for spring break had just been canceled. We went to another AA gate for a later Miami flight to try to get on the standby list. At this gate we spoke to a gentleman. He was very pleasant, added us to the standby list, and then we sat. A few minutes later, he me up to the counter and said he could get us on a flight to Chicago, and from there we could pick up a flight to Miami. I was somewhat incredulous after a) being told that there were no options by the AA ""service"" rep on the phone, and b) being told that by another AA ""service"" rep that he was ""too busy"" to help me. So I asked him to confirm that we would have guaranteed seats to Chicago, and then to Miami. He said yes, and that we'd get in around 9pm. It worked-we made it to Chicago, then Miami, and ultimately only lost 1 day, arriving at our hotel in Miami almost exactly 12 hours late. But we did not lose a hotel night, and we did not have to reschedule anything else. This man saved our vacation. The rest of the AA staff and system is rigid, inflexible, and robotic, and do not try to help customers. They seem perfectly okay with unhappy, sad, disappointed and angry customers. Maybe they see it all the time and are numb to it. Maybe they need better training, maybe they take too much garbage from some customers who no doubt act like jerks. We did not act like jerks because we respect people trying to do their jobs. But we don't respect organizations that foster a culture where most staff clearly don't care about customers and only do the bare minimum for their jobs.

We paid for our baby to have his own seat which the computer couldn’t figure out. The airline doesn’t employ enough staff to have anyone to help with the computer kiosks, so we had to wait in a long, slow line to speak to a person. 45 minutes later, we dealt with an agent who was extremely rude and unhelpful.

American Airlines,2,Ginger Stickel,3rd April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | My family and I had the misfortune of taking a connecting flight from La Guardia through Miami to get to Belize (a number of people on our flight were Belize bound, and others were St Thomas bound). We experienced one and a half hour delays on the day of our flight, first due to a problem by maintenance bringing the plane from the hanger to the gate, and then with baggage loading since we'd missed our scheduled boarding time. Though the pilot tried to make up time (45 minutes), American Airlines, knowing it was a flight full of connecting passengers, and that people like my husband were Platinum Executive, chose to ground us for 30 minutes because they'd made the decision to re-sell our seats after the mishap AA caused at LGA during our one and a half hour delay. It cause many of us to miss our connecting flights, which were the last flight of the day. Perhaps worse is that the pilot and flight attendants made announcements that those on our flight not connecting should remain seated because they were holding our flights. My kids and I ran 20 gates to arrive at our connecting gate 12 minutes before scheduled departure and were refused entry to the plane because the gate agent told us he had already sold our seats (we were meeting friends on the connecting flight who told us that they sold our seats 50 minutes before scheduled departure). What is worse is that we incurred many expenses by missing 24 hours of our vacation including hotel, tour group, private shuttle, plus hotel in Miami last minute during spring break. The airline has said they've officially classified it as ""Air Traffic Control"" even though the pilot repeatedly told us there was an issue getting our plane from the hanger (it didn't come from another city) and that there was a problem loading baggage. We never waited on the tarmac, except after we landed when he said AA didn't have a gate open. The airline treated us like prisoners and unethically chose to profit from our delay caused by maintenance and baggage in NY by re-selling our seats.

I was on a very early flight from Barbados at 7am, on a late booking I got a basic economy seat which meant me having to pay $25US for a seat selection and $25 US for my checked in baggage to go in the under carriage. For an early flight I was hungry, yet not even offered to purchase/buy any snacks as advertised in inflight magazine. In general on a flight of around four hours economy class were offered 1 soft drink from a tray selection and a biscuit! The inflight team of four attendants, seemed quite unfriendly, captains announcements were miniscule. The legroom quite poor, only positive was I wasn't charged for the in flight entertainment. Generally a below average basic schedule on an airline which seems to have plummeted in customer satisfaction!",A319 / A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bridgetown to Miami,March 2018,3,2,1,4,3,3,no
American Airlines,1,Brian E. Smith,3rd April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK to Raleigh Durham. American Airlines is a partner airline through OneWorld with Japan Airlines. I had to purchase a separate ticket with American to get to and from my final destination paired with a mileage ticket on JAL. Huge mistake. Coming over to the US on JAL, they checked my luggage all the way through to my final destination (RDU) and all was smooth. Returning to Tokyo, American Airlines refused no, matter who I spoke to. I was willing to pay for the luggage fees (despite being in business on JAL from JFK) and begged to have them check them all the way through. No go. After this, the flight up to JFK was delayed and the prognosis wasn’t good early on. While trying to get help from a gate agent for rebooking options, I was yelled at! In the end, as a seasoned traveler, I made had to make complicated arrangements to make sure I could get the following day’s connection. The terminal at JFK is substandard as well. The gates are far from the check-in and there are not enough TSA agents working. This is only the second time I’ve flown this routing from Japan to RDU and both times there was only ONE TSA lane open for the entire American Airlines terminal! People were going ballistic! In short, the customer service level of American Airlines is disgraceful and disgusting. Shouting at passengers, unwilling to check bags on partner airlines internationally, delays, and shabby aircraft all made for a horrible experience with them. I’ll never fly them again. I’d say it was like traveling in a developing nation, but even those countries have better facilities, aircraft, and customer service.",ER145,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Raleigh Durham,April 2018,1,3,2,,1,1,no

American Airlines,1,S Saunders,31st March 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Kona to Indianapolis via Dallas. The fiasco started in Kona with an initial 2 hour delay. The trip was to begin at 6:30 PM but did not begin loading unitl 8:30. Then we sat on the plane until 9:30 when we started out of the tarmac and began to taxi and the pilot came over and said the check engine light has came on again, we will need to return to the gate. 30 min later he advised us that United Airlines were in our gate and we were stuck on the tarmac. At 11:00 PM the pilot said we will give everyone an opportunity to deboard the plane, but within 1-2 min after the announcement the pilot came back on the intercom and stated they needed to do a quick engine test and that all passengers were to remain seated, only those in first class had the opportunity to deboard. Those passengers including myself who were still in the process of deboarding were directed back to our seats. Then at 11:45 the staff announced we have another problem, we sat so long we needed refueled but the staff put the fuel in the wrong tank making us unequally balanced, so fuel had to be taken out and placed in the center fuel tank. At 12:30-1 we finally left Hawaii, once at Dallas we had more delays, after missing 3 connections we then headed to a gate with a Chicago destination but unfortunately they did not put my girlfriend on the flight. We were waiting again, they then rerouted us to a direct flight to Indianapolis, we had to run to get there and once again we had a 3 hour mechanical delay. The trip is now over 24 hours and we were not served a meal the entire time, there were no vouchers given for the time inconvenience, no food vouchers as only snacks were offered in the period of 6:30 PM Sunday to 6:30 PM Monday with no time in between to eat a hot meal due to all the missed connections and literally running to the next flight to be only delayed again. In all this after many emails to customer service they only provided ""I'm sorry you had a bad experience, we hope we can do better the next time if you choose to fly with us again and offered only 15K air miles which is the equivalent of maybe $150, when I spent 100K air miles for this trip. Their defensive responses to emails were very inaccurate, unprofessional, condescending and overall poor customer service response was a perfect representation of how I was treated on the flights with American. The lack of a caring, empathetic, customer first attitude is rampant in American Airlines. I would be ashamed to treat people like jailed criminals stuck in an airborne jail cell, limited to a seat with limited movement and then given only a snack and a drink in a 24 hour period.

American Airlines,1,G Murtell,30th March 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Norfolk to Austin via Philadelphia. My first flight was delayed due to an ice sensor issue which made my flight take off get delayed from 6:20 to 7:55. My next flight was at 8:35 from Philly to Austin. My brother and I ran from gate F to gate C to try to make the flight after being told that it was not their responsibility to alert the Austin flight that we were late because of maintenance. When I got to gate 25C the two people are the gate didn’t acknowledge me so my brother said something and they told us to be quiet. They were so rude to us, I couldn’t believe it. Turns out they over booked the flight by 5 seats so they gave away our seats that we paid for because they double messed up. My brother is 6’4 and picked an isle seat because of his bad knees. They gave him a middle seat, but because of some kind passengers we were able to switch seats for him. I ended up sitting in the very back of the plane. When giving us our new seat arrangements, they wrote mine on a piece of paper and just quickly told him his. When he asked them to repeat it the lady told him to check his boarding pass because they were on there but she took his boarding pass. American Airlines acts like they’re above treating people like people; it makes my skin crawl. I will not forget how that lady looked at me with her smug face.

American Airlines,2,Keyonee Stoner,30th March 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Philadelphia. I don’t know where to start. I’ve become so disgusted with American Airlines lately. My husband and I travel very often. He’s Executive Platinum with American and travels well over 100k miles a year. I’ve been considering switching airlines due to the terrible customer service we’ve been receiving. We spend too much money to not be treated well. The last 3 trips we’ve taken have been hell. We had to call customer service multiple times to check in and get out tickets corrected. Every agent told us they were going to fix the problem but of course never did so we ended up almost missing flights because of it. Our return flight 3/29/18 was a disaster. We had a 30 minute delay leaving Philly so ended up missing our connection at 2:30. They put up on the standby list for one flight and also booked us for another flight. We ended up having to get on the second flight which was due to leave at 6:50pm from Dallas but ended up being delayed until 9:00pm. It was such a disaster. We lost our upgrade due to the delayed flight and having to switch flights. We had to travel 3.5 hours uncomfortably. We were suppose to make it back to LAX by 4:54 and didn’t return until 10:30pm.

Only had cash on me so I had to pay an additional $5 to get a card to use to check my bag. Then when seated on the plan an attendant rudely told a bigger male passenger that he should have had enough to fly first class for a bigger seat because his seatbelt couldn’t buckle.

Food amount for each service was adequate. Food tasted awesome. The IFE works really good. Response time is quick and tons of material to choose from. The legroom in the Main Cabin Extra is quite spacious. I can only imagined a 6’ tall person will be very comfortable in this section. The cabin itself was clean, neat and smells fresh.

I am allergic to nuts, so I asked to substitute the nuts for a second portion of crackers. I was told that was impossible. The attendant was curt and rude and hid in the corner playing games on her iPad. Wifi is not included and the gogo pay for play took over an hour to get sorted out on my devices. Totally not worth the time required, let alone the money. The plane also did not have any USB outlets or 110V outlets, even in first class!

To make matters worse, I saw various other people throughout my adventure of acquiring my bags having a similar experience. Once lady coming to the US from Australia for a funeral had the bag-checker say ""give me the bag, we fly everywhere"" without tagging it, of course it was lost.

However, since they resolved that issue, the pilot has been late, they have been unable to find flight attendants, and now - right before our supposed departure time of 4:25 - have to refuel the plane. Things happen of course, but the negligence and failure of AA to resolve these issues as quickly as possible is undeniable. This is also not the first time I have experienced significant delays on the airline.

I explained to her it needed to go to Miami not Orlando, after her checking her information she explained to me that it might have been a ""glitch"" in the system and the only way I was getting my bag was to go to Orlando.

Flight was delayed for 3+ hours because American Airlines decided to schedule maintenance and make it a rolling delay and because of the huge delay I missed my layover in Charlotte and was forced to stay in a hotel after being at the airport for 8+ hours.

I usually fly with Southwest and will stick to Southwest from now on. Everyone working at American Airlines was very rude. You can’t ask anyone a question without them getting smart with you. Baggage check in took so long and it was literally 5 ppl in front of me. They were working like they wanted you to be late for your flight. The baggage man got smart with me because I asked him 2 questions about my bags. Worst customer service ever. Everyone acted like they hated their job, if your that miserable work somewhere else where you don’t have to deal with customer service!

American Airlines,2,S Tanner,4th March 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Phoenix to Chicago O'Hare. Was three hours early and waiting for flight. Quite unprofessional airport as no belt, shoes, or computer check, security just let us walk through a metal detector. As I waited at the gate many flights were cancelled because American Airlines flight attendants didn't fulfill work assignment. Several AA employees speaking unprofessionally at the gate and running around somewhat frantically. Then I hear my gate was reassigned. It took me 10 minutes to walk over there and the plane had departed. They didn't assure a seat on another plane, but assigned me to standby all day. No apology. No empathy.

American Airlines,1,A Leasure,3rd March 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Nashville to Savannah via Charlotte. I bought two round-trip tickets to SAV, the flights to Savannah were great and we had no problems what so ever. The problem was on the way home when they pushed our connecting flight up by 40 minutes while we were in flight to Charlotte. I don't understand how the crew can make that decision to move a flight up by 40 minutes, meaning we missed our connecting flight which was also the last flight of the night at 11:15pm. When I called AA support she informed me that the plane didn't actually leave the ground until 11:29 pm and there is no reason they shouldn't have let us on the plane. She then said to tell the agent that we need hotel vouchers to which the agent said ""no sorry we can't"" and the representative on the phone was baffled at her response. All of us that missed our connecting flight were then kicked out of 2 terminals, no hotel, no food or water, offered to us. The AA agents in the SAV airport did provide us with snacks and drinks for our 2 hour delay so I was astonished that nothing was provided for a 12 hour delay. We were not put on another flight until 8:55 am the following morning meaning we had extra fees charged for storing our cars, missing work, and sitters. What makes me even more mad is I filed a claim with AA claims department and they sent me back the most ""we don't care"" email. Saying that AA feels that their customers should have to pay for extra cost such as hotels, transportation, parking fees, storage fees, and any other fees that we were charged for missing our flight due to the airline changing their times. I have never felt so disrespected by a company as much as I have with American Airlines. I was not asking for my full refund because 3 out of 4 of my flights were great and the crew was awesome except for CLT and the service I have been given so far. All I wanted was my extra fees reimbursed. Very disappointed with how we were all treated. I had booked all my upcoming flights with American Airline and have since cancelled every last one of them, I would never want someone else to be treated the way we were.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Savannah via Charlotte,February 2018,2,2,2,2,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,N Allen,2nd March 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Boston to Phoenix. Let me start by saying we travel a lot. We have never dealt with such rude and incompetent customer service in our lives. Over the course of two flights (roundtrip) we contacted American Airlines customer service about 7-8 times both over the phone and in person at the airport (customer service desk, gate agent) all regarding the same issue. They all gave us different answers and in some cases flat out incorrect information. We had issues with seats, with bags, but most importantly - when people are paying - any amount of money for that matter - you address their concerns in some way. After this awful travel experience we contacted their corporate customer service and got basically - sorry - can't help, fly with us again please. Even worse they clearly didn't even read the complaint. In the response they addressed the wrong issue and claimed I was travelling with my wife (I was travelling with my husband). Their lack of concern for customers is evident in the fact that they can't even read their emails fully. The whole process has just been incredibly frustrating - this business should be ashamed of themselves.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Phoenix,February 2018,1,1,,,1,1,no

On arriving at Orlando (MCO) to check in we were informed that our flights to Gatwick (LGW) via New York (JFK) was cancelled due to bad weather (snow), the AA representative was very abrupt and unhelpful with regard to our situation with two young children and elderly person with health problems. We were rebooked onto a flight via Charlotte to Heathrow entailing a 14 hour wait at MCO airport with no assistance with hotels or food offered and virtually abandoned at the Airport by both AA (and BA with who we had made the booking). By the time we were able to check on availability of hotel rooms we found that there were none left. No suggestions or assistance had been offered but we made the decision to split our party into two and were able to obtain slightly earlier flights for the children and their parents but this still involved a nine wait for a connecting flight at Chicago and arriving at LHR instead of LGW.

Later on the plane I was seated in the exit row. The plane was not full and apparently this lady and her companion were not seated together. The aisle seats in the exit row were both open. This pair moved into these seats. I fully expected the flight attendant to make them move because someone wheeled onto a plane is obviously not physically capable of helping anyone in an emergency. She did not. While I'm not a body builder, I am capable of lifting that 45 lb door and assisting others. These two obviously are not.

American Airlines,1,G Meirs,28th February 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Phoenix to Yuma. The man in seat in front of me was in row 1 of first class (It was a very tiny plane and the upgrade was only $59 so I was treating myself). Passenger 1 was jovial and talkative and showed me a paper cutout of ""Flat Stanley"". (http://www.flatstanleyproject.com/) He was taking photos and videos of Stanley everywhere for his 6yr old daughter. While we were waiting to leave the gate, I heard him talking and asked if he was talking to Flat Stanley. He said that no, he was taking a video of him on the plane for his daughter. One of the stewardesses yelled at him to shut it off. He asked why and explained that he was videoing this doll for his daughter. She was rude and demanding and made him shut off the camera saying he was not allowed to video staff. (Is that even a thing? I can't imagine it's a thing). The passenger complied but was talking to us other passengers and commenting when she was around that she was violating his rights and she might not have a job after he talked to the airline. I said she was probably having a bad day and he should just let it go. When we landed, the doors did not open. A man came up from the back of plane. He was dressed plainly. (jeans and a long sleeved t-shirt, I think it was.) I saw handcuffs hanging from his belt on the small of his back. He stepped into the cockpit with cranky stewardess and shut the door. The next thing I know, ""officer"" is demanding me to get out of my seat and making me stand in the aisle by the stewardesses. It is important to note that he did not identify himself to me or show me a badge. He ordered me around and informed Passenger 1 that he needed to sit there and me to wait. I asked the ""officer"" if he needed me as a witness because I saw it all and this was a horrible misunderstanding. He didn't want to talk to me and did not want my info. I could tell this was looking very bad for Passenger 1. I hastily wrote my name and number on a piece of paper from my purse and gave it to Passenger 1 and offered my help if he needed. When I was told I could deplane, Passenger 1 was still being held inside, He asked if he could take my picture so he could text it to his family so they could find me to let them know what was going on. When I deplaned there were police outside talking to the captain. Turns out, the stewardess said that Passenger 1 threatened her! I was shaking I was so angry at the lie and the injustice. I gave the officers my information and told them what happened. I waited in the airport and Passenger 1 finally came out. He was released and the officers told me all was dismissed. I cannot express strongly enough how angry and horrified I was that in United States of America, we were badgered and pushed around (By a man who did not even bother to identify himself) all because some American Airlines stewardess lied about a passenger and could have caused an innocent man to be on a do-not-fly list or worse, go to jail. To this day, I do not know Passenger 1’s name. He was a stranger to me. But he was unjustly detained and put at personal risk by American Airlines and I hope all is well with him today.",,Solo Leisure,First Class,Phoenix to Yuma,January 2018,2,1,1,,2,1,no

I missed my scheduled flight and had to rebook, the representative at the airport put me on standby for a flight several hours later, telling me that I would ""probably get on."" However, the flight was full, and after waiting around for over three hours I rebooked for the following day. I arrived at the airport two hours early this time, only to find my first flight had been delayed by two hours. I received a message on my phone that this might cause me to miss my connection in Chicago, so I attempted to change flights via mobile website. However, upon submission it displayed an error message about the action not being completed. So I decided to wait, hoping the delay wouldn't make me miss my connection. Unfortunately, despite what the online booking told me, they had in fact given my seat on the first flight away. The attendants were very helpful and I was able to get onto a flight to Dallas Fort Worth, where I could pick up a connection home. But this new flight was full enough that I was required to check my carry-on. The flight was fine but when I arrived in Dallas, I found my connecting flight wasn't for another hour. I settled in to wait, but after only half an hour or so, it was announced that the flight had been delayed by two more hours. And because I was forced to check my bag, I had no way of changing to an earlier flight. The staff were nice enough to put out some drinks and snacks, but I'm unsure of whether that was organized by American or by the airport. The second flight had no in-flight entertainment or even an outlet, though the staff were pleasant. Overall not a great flight experience.

The cabin had drop down TV monitors, no movie selection was available though you could choose from a range of music channels. Seats were wide and leg space ample. It might have been more relaxing if there were foot rests. We were kept informed of the progress of our flight including any holding delays near JFK. I found all this information very useful. Another well run flight by American Airlines - on time departure/arrival, helpful and informative staff, a decent meal and snacks, and clean cabin and lavatory.

American Airlines,1,Jeffrey Atkins,20th February 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew San Diego to Philadelphia. I've avoided American airlines at all costs and only fly with them when my company books my travel. They are the worst in customer service. The plane is clean but my flight had no entertainment available. No big deal for me, but a 6 hour flight should have a plane with something. Forced to check my roller at the gate due to space availability, get on the plane and there's tons of space. That annoys me to no end, and they just don't care about your personal belongings (whether you receive them and the baggage claim). I hate American Airlines, from the first time they lost my bag with my most important belongings, then gave me the run around to avoid helping me retrieve my bag or reimburse me.

The attendee informed me they had one minute and forty five seconds to get there. Then she informed me we were all ""degated"" and she had a volunteer she was going to seat. 1 minute 45 seconds has not expired yet and she says the door is closed and shuts the door.

American Airlines customer service at Philadelphia International Airport has totally gone to pot. Now you not only have to tag your own bag and put it on the conveyor, but you have to put up with some of the rudest counter staff in the airline industry. After I tagged my bag, I went to weigh it and the woman asked for my boarding pass and ID. I held it out for her and she asked again for my boarding pass and ID. I said here it is, and she said again boarding pass and ID. She would not take it or ask me to display it, she just asked for boarding pass and ID. So, I separated them and she said OK. She didn’t get a look at the ID, just saw that I had it in my hand. I could have shown her a library card as far as she knew. Then at the TSA, when I walked up to the Kiosk and held out my boarding pass and ID for the woman there she didn’t take it, she pointed to the front of the kiosk where she wanted me to stand without saying a word. I fly into PHL often and this was the worst customer service I have ever had at any airport.

American Airlines,1,R Teale,12th February 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Dayton to Jacksonville via Charlotte. I had found trip tickets for 2/5/18 and this had to be the worst experience flying I could have imagined. My first flight was fine but when I reached Charlotte I was informed that my connecting flight was delayed so much so that it was going to ruin my plans to see my husband who is active duty military. I was able to switch flights to land in New Bern NC rather than OAJ, but then I had to rent a vehicle to drive an additional hour to get to my destination. In the midst of all this my flight back to Charlotte was delayed 4 times and my time with my husband was spent trying to figure out how I was to get home now since my connecting flight (last flight of the evening) was now going to be missed leaving me stranded in Charlotte. I only ended up getting to spend 1 hour with him and I do not know when I will see him again...i drove to the airport in hopes that I could get a connecting flight home but there was none...so I took the flight I had from OAJ to Charlotte and had to get yet another rental to drive 7.5 hours through the night to get home in time to head right back out to work. It was the worst day and it's almost impossible to get anyone to assist with any kind of refund. What was a $500 trip ended up costing well over $900.

A breakfast was served - there were two choices. Drinks and snacks were regularly offered. Our coats were taken and hung up. The flight attendant serving the cabin was efficient. The wi-fi did not work. There were no personal entertainment screens. One needed to stare at a wall mounted screen, cheap head phones were provided. Ample leg space but the seat did not recline.

American Airlines,1,H Simpson,10th February 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Where do I even begin with this airline? I could start by saying I will never be flying with them again. American has not once, but twice lost my infant car seat, stroller, and base when flying with a 5 month old baby. My most recent flight I had checked my stroller, car seat and base at my gate, when I arrived in Dallas for my layover it was nowhere to be found. When I asked for assistance it seemed that no one working for American had any idea what they were doing. One gentleman unloading baggage was trying his best to help us by calling his supervisor who took 30-40 minutes to even answer the phone. We got sent back and forth between employees who didn't feel like dealing with us and told us things like ""I honestly have no idea how to do this"". ""Baggage claim isn't answering my calls"" and things like ""You are going to have to go back to the gate you came from I don't have time to deal with this"". The most frustrating moment was when the supervisor finally showed up 40 minutes later, meanwhile I am holding my sick, hysterical child on my hip in the airport trying not to miss my next flight that leaves in 30 minutes. The supervisor drives past us in a baggage car, not even stopping saying ""you are going to have to call baggage claim and see where it is, I don't know what to tell you, it must be lost somewhere"". It was the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I was then told to go to my next gate and wait there so I didn't miss my next flight. So I carried my child to the opposite end of the airport with no stroller and no extra hands to carry my personal items. When I arrived at my next gate and told the new American employee what was going on she responded by saying. ""Oh, you're going to have to go back to the gate you came from. That isn't in my department since you came from a different gate"". So extremely frustrating! I then proceeded to ask the employee how she expected me and my child to get home from the airport with no car seat or base when I arrive at my final destination. She then stated that I can file a claim with American and ""maybe"" they will supply me with a used one to get home from the airport. $250 later my husband had to meet me at the airport, 2 hours from our home with a brand new car seat and base we had to purchase so that we could safely leave the airport with our child. When we arrived at our final destination we were then told our baggage had never even left the first airport we left from. American Airlines stated if they could find our items they would send them to our address. Two days later an American airline employee shows up at our house at 1am with our items! One o clock in the morning! This is one of the most ridiculous and stressful experiences I have dealt with. American not only has terrible customer service but not one of their employees was knowledgeable or accommodating to our situation. This was a nightmare and totally unacceptable! I would advise anyone to steer clear of flying American Airlines. Thank goodness for family that was able to meet me at the airport with new items to get home, otherwise I may have been stuck at the airport with my child all night!

American Airlines,2,W Jackson,10th February 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Poor customer service after delayed flights with American Airlines. Arrived at Columbia early to try and get another flight because I knew weather was bad today and it was going to be bad across the country. Even though the plane had 8+ seats on both legs to Cleveland I was refused standby and was not allowed to purchase a ticket. You lost an additional sale - someone needs some more training. So, as I guessed original flight from CAE is delayed. When the aircraft arrives, absolutely no hustle by anyone to get the plane boarded. I will give props to the pilot - was ready to push off immediately and made up some time in the air. Land in Washington and have to wait for the ground crew to move equipment out of the way. Really? How does this happen when we were due in 30 minutes ago? We have to wait for all luggage to be pulled and the wait for the bus driver to take us to the terminal. No attempts made to speed anything up. Finally make it to the terminal about 2 minutes late, and no effort is made to route another bus to the plane even though there were 15+ minutes until scheduled take off. I asked to check on other flights and he said he couldn't help me as he stares at his computer in front of him. I eventually make it onto another delayed flight after finding someone with some empathy. When you know all of you're flights are late, make an effort to care and try to be prepared and efficient. And it would be nice to hold flights for a few minutes when you know connecting flights are on the ground, but that's understandable not to hold them. 2 points for the pilot.

Firstly, we sat in our plane on the runway way for 2 hours before taking off (being told mixed stories as to why we were delayed). We missed our connecting flight (and our upgraded seats we paid for and had to basically argue about upon arriving). When we finally got to our destination (3 hours late and missing our transportation we had paid for) our luggage was missing. The employees had zero empathy for us for our travel day from hell and handed us a form for our lost luggage (the form had a contact number which we couldn't get through to the following day after multiple attempts of calling). We were told to buy what we needed and we would be reimbursed (we had literally nothing until we got our luggage the following evening). A month after I began the reimbursement process I received a response from American Airlines stating that they don't reimburse for personal belongings due to lost luggage although it's clearly stated that they do on their website.

American Airlines,3,Tanveer Ahmed,2nd February 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I would like to share the horrible experience that I had flying with American Airlines. I bought tickets from them to travel from Toronto to Houston and return. Toronto to Chicago to Houston (01/24/2018) Houston to Dallas to Toronto (01/29/18) The flight from Toronto to Houston was ok except for an hour delay. Everything turned into a nightmare when we were travelling back from Houston. Our flight from Houston was at 4:20PM (45 mins flight to Dallas) and our connecting flight from Dallas to Toronto was at 6:25PM (2hr 25 mins to Toronto). We got on the flight at 4:20 and we were stuck there for almost 1.5 hrs. According to the captain the air control did not give clearance and the plane had to refuel since it did not plan for the delay. After 1.5 hours they informed that we will not be able to catch our connecting flight from Dallas so it’s better to get off and re-book from Houston. We got off and asked to get our checked-in luggage. They said they cannot take that out and it will be going to Dallas. So we asked them what our options were since do not want to lose our luggage. During this time we got the notification that our flight was re-booked from Dallas at 7AM the next day (01/30/18), which meant we had to stay the night at Dallas. After discussing at the gate and with the flight crew they confirmed us that since we have a check-in baggage it will be better for us to go to Dallas and as it was an airline issue, accommodation will be provided for the night. We were convinced and agreed to get in the flight again and go for Dallas where we reached at 6:57PM (instead of 5:37PM) This is where everything started. After getting off the plane we went to talk to gate staff (as instructed) for our accommodation voucher and that is when they said ""Since it is not our fault, we will not be able to provide accommodation. In our system we see that it is coded for Tarmac delay due to clearance from Air Control which led to refueling"". We told them repeatedly that we were took off that plane and put back in and assured that there will be accommodation provided. We just had to talk to the gate. After that they said, ""Well sir, I do not see anything documented/coded in your account, therefore I cannot do anything. The best we can do is provide you hotels at distress rate"" The minimum amount of distress rate they offered was USD 65 without shuttle and if we wanted shuttle it would USD 75. Why would we pay anything? Was it our fault? We did not take their offer and the funny thing is the hotel we ended up staying “Days Inn hotel” was available on Booking.com for USD 65 with shuttle service. I do not know what kind of distress rate were they offering. You can find a copy of my hotel receipt below. We spent almost 2.5 hours travelling from Houston to Dallas and hearing them say that just made us frustrated and speechless. We were supposed to be at work the next day on 01/30/2018, so which meant 1 extra day leave from work.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Toronto via Dallas,January 2018,5,2,,,2,3,no

American Airlines,7,Neil Jeram,29th January 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Sydney. I really want to like and love AA! This was the return leg from LA booked on a Qantas code. Now originally I had been coming back on QF74 via SFO. However due to ATC issues in SFO three out of four flights leaving LAX were cancelled. Too their credit AA sorted the problem out and found a space on AA73 back to Sydney. That meant a bus ride back to T4 at LAX from one of the outlying terminals that AA uses. In addition a delay of 3 hours over the departure time of QF74. A separate review of the lounge at T4 but suffice to say I had a lot of time to kill. Books and phones help! Now the flight itself was on AA73 which is a B787 -9. Was keen to try this as it is the plane around which Qantas are building their future. Most if not all of my long haul is on the Airbus A380 with QF or EK. So the Boeing felt and was smaller.Ceilings were high and windows bit bigger but not as quiet as the Airbus. Being new everything had that new car feel to it! So the hard product is fine albeit I had better get used to it. It is the soft product where AA fails. On entering the craft the FA said: do I have to tell you where to go? The food service was hurried and without any real warmth. I appreciate that FA's are working in cramped conditions and so will always ask an FA how his or her day is going and smile. US crews just seem not too care, its a job for them and they just do it on auto pilot. The famed US levels of service with a smile have long since gone. The seat, 24B was a nightmare. Exit row but so narrow and uncomfortable. The Boeing 787 is probably OK for flights up to 9/10 hours but beyond that I would not take it.

My experience with American Airlines as a whole is abysmal, however, there was an instance that occurred last night that is ridiculous. My husband and I were flying from Cancun to Charlotte and then Omaha. Our flight to Charlotte landed about ten minutes late, we then had to go through immigration, customs, and security again and make it to our next flight that was in one hour. We got through everything as quickly as we could and then ran to the gate our flight was leaving out of and had missed it by 3 minutes. The workers at that gate directed us to a service desk to help with rerouting our flight. We explained the situation to the service desk and they put us on standby on a flight in the morning and reported that they could not confirm this flight for us because missing the flight was our fault. We asked for a hotel voucher for the night and this was refused for the same reason - that missing our flight was our fault. They refused to do anything else. The plane was late, we had to wait in three lines to get to a gate on the opposite end of the terminal, and these three lines took their sweet ass time.

We took four flights with them from Heathrow to Cancun via Miami and it was consistently bad. I hated that there was a surcharge for sitting together, something you expect when you are flying with a budget airline but not transatlantic flight. The food was dreadful, I am one of those rare people who quite like airplane food, but this was not good. “Chicken or pasta” was the mantra all the way down the aisle and when I asked for more information I just got chicken or pasta repeated. How about giving a full description over the tannoy and then no need to repeat it 300 times? I genuinely did not know what I was eating, it was unrecognisable. I left almost everything apart from the water. Finally the crew, really not nice people and only one flight attendant out of all we interacted with was pleasant. Their culture is one of (almost) intimidation, very unfriendly even for a Brit. I know they are probably tired but there was a real feeling that we were a nuisance and they don’t want to offer a service - not that we used the bell once during any of their flights.

I had to check my bag and with no prior notification given. I was told they do not accept cash. So I had to purchase a card the would convert my cash to be applicable. The catch to it is they charge $5 just to purchase the card. The manager on duty at the time was of no help. For the information I had to physically call the customer service phone number while at airport. I do not believe I will do business with American Airlines. I am a frequent flyer and I've never been subject to these type of regulations.

American Airlines,1,Jaakko Meriläinen,26th January 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I recently traveled from Stockholm to San Juan via London and Miami. The flight from London to Miami was delayed by 40 minutes, due to which American Airlines decided to bump me off from the connecting flight - as confirmed by the customer service. Despite the delay, I would have been able to make it to the flight well before it departed. People who arrived to the gate after me were allowed to board. Later, I was told by the customer service that I was bumped off to make sure that the plane would leave on time. This seems to be in conflict with what I experienced. Instead of sending me a message about me being bumped off the flight, American Airlines sent me emails about the flight being delayed. Had I been informed on time that I was not on the flight anymore, I could have gone to the re-booking counter right away. Now I ended up going to the gate and waiting there. I tried to ask the airline why they do not inform their customers about this kind of changes and if they believe it would be appropriate to do so, but received no answer at all. I ended up spending 24 hours in Miami on standby before getting on a flight to San Juan. I was constantly told by the airline staff at the airport that people would be let to board flights in the order they appear on the standby list. Yet, many people who were behind me on the list were allowed to board before me. I was in contact with the American Airlines customer service about the depressing experience with the airline. They struggled to give me a proper explanation on why I was bumped off the flight and the overall treatment I got at the airport. I exchanged three emails with the customer service but they failed to provide any coherent responses, which - I believe - is the least the airline could have done.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to San Juan,January 2018,3,3,,,1,1,no

I missed a flight by 5 minutes, because of my incoming flight from Europe was late due to security issues. And even though it was the last flight of the night they would not hold the plane, for 5 minutes, and they wouldn’t put me up in a hotel because it wasn’t their fault. Well it wasn’t my fault either.

American Airlines,1,M Andrews,25th January 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I can see by the reviews here that American Airlines could not care less about bad reviews. I wouldn’t even give them one star if I had a choice. For an international flight, we purchased additional miles for $1300 so that we would have enough miles to fly “main cabin extra”. (This is an extra cost over regular coach because you get extra leg room and other benefits). Being claustrophobic, I needed the seats that we originally chose. AA changed the plane that they were going to fly to Australia (a 15.5 hour flight from LA) and took it upon themselves to move us to much worse seats in the regular coach section. My husband is a Platinum flier for life with 3 million miles flown on AA. After speaking to several supervisors at the platinum desk and writing to customer service, AA refused to do anything about it. At the very least, they should have refunded the $1300 that we had to pay to purchase extra miles in order to get the upgraded section! Shame on you American Airlines. It’s no wonder that you no longer carry an elite status in the airline industry if this is how you treat your customers who have been loyal to you for many years!

American Airlines,1,Hennessy Goicochea,24th January 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Miami to New York. This has been the worst experience ever, when it comes to boarding they should have an estimate on how many people have a carry on and there is no reason there is never space for everyone’s carry on. Also, the staff becomes rude when they start to tell you that you have to check in your bag, the problem I have with this is that they let certain people go and it becomes a personal judgement call rather than actually determining if someone has a larger carry on. Up entering I saw plenty of space still available even right above me there was a completely empty over bin.

Meaning if you had two bags the cost of adding another checked bag (my duffle bag) that should fit in overhead. You would pay $35 on top of what you had to pay for any checked in bags to begin with.

American Airlines,2,M Dalton,22nd January 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | We had four itineraries on AA during our recent holiday to the US and Mexico with the final and worst being from Cancun to Miami. Some slight improvements since they ""lost"" our luggage years ago (and almost had to be sued for compensation) but still a 2 star airline. Boarding usually a shambles exacerbated by people flying with pets (dog fights at gates comical). Also people travelling with too much carry on causing huge delays. It isn't such an issue in other countries I'm not sure why such a problem with US airlines after having so many years to address the problem,. The real entertainment is usually the cabin crew, who I am sure are mostly nice people, it is just that their standard of training and presentation takes the joy out of the entire experience. Whilst all flights were pleasant enough, just walking onto a plane to see two poorly dressed flight attendants standing with their backs to you eating, instead of greeting customers is so bad it's hilarious. And it was the same for each of the seven legs we took over these three tickets. Apart from that the flights offered a variety of mediocre experiences from airplane condition to not being offered headphones in first class, but that didn't bother us as much as the dreadful presentation and complete lack of pride and professionalism. We only fly AA for the status credits to keep our Qantas Platinum (Oneworld Emerald), I hope that AA's recent image overhaul is still underway and better training standards on the horizon. Note - there isn't a Oneworld lounge at CUN and AA will not check your bags beyond USA, even though we were connecting to another Oneworld airline in biz class - Qatar (talk about chalk and cheese). This is appalling. We wasted 2hrs going through immigration to collect and re check our bags.

Apparently as boarding group 9, you are no longer even allotted a once normal sized carry on bag. It must be checked and if you do self check in, and miss this, they will charge you 50$ at the gate to check a carry on bag. I fly once a month every month to and from San Francisco-Cleveland.

My son wears a splint and usually on Europe and domestic flights he is able to remove the splint and put it back on in his seat. But this flight from Chicago to Manchester was so cramped he was unable to do this. No hydration was offered, no space to stand up, and the vegetarian meals we ordered were not available.

Need to give credit where credit is due - well done AA! That being said, the ex-US Airways A320s with absolutely no in-flight entertainment are really starting to grind my gears - they need to be put out of their misery.

American Airlines,3,Jasmine Thomas,18th January 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I am writing this letter in utter disgust and frustration. I was travelling on A2657 from Orlando to Miami on 14/1/18 with what was to be a connecting flight to Antigua on A2405. Much to my surprise, we landed at MIA 5 minutes early, only to be held on the tarmac for an hour, all because there was an aircraft still at the gate, so much for being early. So AA had a plane for an hour, on the tarmac just waiting with passengers who had connecting flights. To make matters worst being the concerned passenger I asked the head flight attendant a question, to which she had the audacity to rudely state that I should have flew in the night before. The nerve of her. After finally being able to deplane & having to scramble to G21, much to my demise the flight had already closed off, and instead of aiding assistance to an already frustrated me, the female agent rudely said we are not getting on. Seems like some of these females employed by AA need training. The male agent made it his priority to calm an already angered me. Good Job to him. He advised me that the airline would accept fault. You would think that my anger would have ended there. After being told that I would be placed in a hotel at the expense of the airline, I was given a $12 food voucher. Really American. I had to pay an additional $15 for proper food. Another Issue was the shuttle that was to take me to the hotel had me waiting 2 hours, by this time I had given up. Fast forward to Monday 15th shall we, I got to the airport thinking it would be a better day but no, here I was thinking that my first class seat 4C would still be available so I could at least have one thing to smile about.

It was by far the most stressful plane ride for us because we had to carry both kids, all the bags, the install the chair into the seat with everyone on the flight looking at us. There were several flight attendants looking at us with faces that screamed, hurry up and get to your seats because we have to fly. In fact, one flight attendant was more focused on gathering her suitcases to get off the plane then: “hey, let me help you guys?!” From this experience if you’re not going to board parents with small children first or help them get settled and off the plane safely, then I’m never going to fly with my family on this plane because it wasn’t kid-friendly.

As we approached our gate we were informed our flight was cancelled because the crew was sick. We were then made to stand in lines for 4 hours to get our luggage back from off the plane. We were sent away from the airport to a hotel, still with no information on a rescheduled flight. We were then contacted for the next two days with constantly changing information about our rebooking. American Airlines also miscommunicated to the hotel the value of our food vouchers; we were told a particular value in the airport, and the hotel was only told half the amount. two days after our scheduled departure, we were rebooked, loaded back in a bus to the airport, and upon parking and unloading, informed that our flight had been cancelled again; we were sent back to the hotel. Finally, three days later we were put into a flight with a different airline and were able to get back to the US. I missed two days of work and had to buy a completely new ticket for a connecting flight in the US because of the delay, and they offered a measly voucher worth less than half the cost of the original flight. I wrote a complaint email, detailed with pictures and information, and American Airlines headquarters refused to budge. I'm extremely displeased. I also flew American Airlines in September and my plane had to make an emergency landing due to engine failure.

American Airlines,5,L Barrat,12th January 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew from Seattle to Boston via Philadelphia. Navigating American’s area in Seattle was easy enough. We checked in at the self-serve kiosks. Boarded on time and got into the air in good time. The first leg was aboard their newly-configured Airbus A321. I was in seat 26F. The seat was pretty old on the 5-hour flight. Width felt very tight, and the legroom was made difficult by a low-hanging seat and my underseat storage occupied. Also, the streaming IFE did not work for the entire flight. Things quickly got very boring. Cabin service was on par, however the flight attendants did seem very unenthusiastic. Connection in Philadelphia was pretty simple, however we had a long walk between gates that would have been difficult with a short connection time. The flying time up to Boston was very quick. I was occupying seat 20F on the Airbus A320, and it was significantly more comfortable. The seat width was the same, but I was able to get my bag further under the seat, which allowed for greater legroom. Cabin service was better on this leg, however it was a short flight. IFE streaming was again not working properly, but it was a short hop so I didn’t mind. Overall, my experience on American got me back across the country, but the “cattle class” narrative certainly being applied. Thankfully, it wasn’t too expensive, but I expected a little more from a legacy carrier. Every LCC experience I’ve had recently has been better.

American Airlines,1,Nathanael Griggs,10th January 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I’ve never wrote an review for anything in my life. But from my last experience from American Airlines, I made it my obligation to review this poor flight. I had a flight from Norfolk to San Diego via Dallas. I arrive at my flight on time just for them to delay my flight for an hour. Finally take off and when I arrive at Dallas my flight was just now taking off. I was extremely annoyed. Had to wait in a line for up to an hour and a half since there was an absurd amount of people that missed their flight as well. Was told that my next guaranteed flight will be that next following day, but I have the option to wait for the last available flights of that night, I will just be on stand by. Waited for 3 long hours to see if me and my girlfriend can squeeze in but we got denied. I was told I was number 14 on the list but another administrator told me I was number 12 on the stand by list. Very unorganized. The only positive thing that came from this was that they gave us an hotel voucher for the night. However, I was told that my bags had already took off without me and I will have to go get them at the baggage claim when I arrive at SD. Not only that, but when I was in a line for my hotel voucher, you can even hear the customer assistance saying “I’m leaving in 2 minutes, Im going home.” Mind you there are groups of people waiting to find a place to stay that have been traveling all day long. What type of service is that? Glad to know that American Airlines care about their passengers. That next following morning I wait by the gate to board my flight that was around 06:20. Came to find out that they switched the flight to another gate number when I went to the help desk to see if I was at the right location. Thank god I asked or I would of missed out on another flight. Nobody even notified us that the gate number even had changed. What type of service is that? I will never in my life fly this company again.

When we got to the ticket counter the (rude) woman told us they had given our seats away. My 5 month pregnant wife and I sprinted to make this flight so we could make it to our party in time. This woman could not have cared less. They gave our seats away and we were there. The customer service rep informed us that a refund would not be given because they put us on a different flight. That is completely besides the point and with any honor American would have done the right thing and given us a refund since they were the sole reason we missed our party.

Contacted a woman on American Airlines who changed our flights to go home via New York so the baby could get better and we arrived at Providenciales to find that our flights had been changed to economy from business class and also that we would have to pay baggage fees. Now in New York trying to get home and we are being charged again for flight to Glasgow! I am utterly disgusted with this airline.

American Airlines,1,N Ivers,8th January 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Santo Domingo to New York. January 1st, 2018. We’ve been stuck at the airport in Santo Domingo since 1:30 only to find out our flight is pushed to 10 am next day. American Airline knew way before 1:30pm that they did not have enough crew to fly but didn’t bother telling customers until 7pm. They knew that crew that was flying in will not fly back because they had to take mandatory break. Do they have any regard for their customers?‬ Nothing stopping them from charging $1,200 for economy tickets and $25 for the first checked bag on a top of that. But they feel that it's perfectly fine not to inform their passengers about the flight that won't be flying any time soon. Were they too afraid to lose some money from that ridiculas fare? This is a complete ignorance or incompetence. The way they put it ""a mistake the company made"". A mistake they said they’ve fixed already. There was a news article by major news outlet 2-3 weeks ago that American Airline granted too much PTO time to their pilots and crews for the holiday season and major service outages are expected. AA responded that issue is resolved and no delays or cancellations are expected. I guess it was just a PR spin.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Santo Domingo to New York,January 2018,3,1,1,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,G Samson,8th January 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Cleveland to Punta Cana via Charlotte. We travelled as a family of 8 for Christmas to Punta Cana. Thanks to AA we missed a whole day in Punta Cana because we missed our flight to Charlotte. We missed the flight because we were waiting for staff to bring a wheelchair for my grandmother who cannot walk through an airport. When we got to the gate, staff said the plane was gone and we were 2 min late. Staff even acknowledged that the time stamp on our luggage was an hour before boarding time. We waited an hour for a wheelchair. We told them we could push the chair but they did not allow it. There was only one lady working the wheelchair area. Of course it being the holidays they could not get us to our destination that day. We flew to Charlotte that day but had to stay the night. They gave us 1 room for my grandmother since she needed the wheelchair, but we had to pay for additional rooms. I guess AA thought we could have left an old lady and got on a flight without her. We are a family! We come together and leave together! The luggage was a whole other situation. We had the AA agent check all of our luggage tickets. She ensured us that once we missed the flight our luggage did not go either. Well, my luggage was in Punta Cana without me. Once we made it to Punta Cana only 1 family member's luggage came on the belt! Total disaster and staff had no idea where it was. Everyone elses luggage eventually came and all was good. I am very disappointed in AA, we even tried to get refunds and just cancel the trip. They would not give refunds because they said it was our fault that we missed the original flight. We had travel insurance. This is the short version of what happened. The misinformation from AA agents in Cleveland, Charlotte, and Punta Cana is another story. Never again. Oh no wifi on the plane, but the flight attendants were nice. On the way home, I did have to listen to the flight attendants entire personal conversations because I was sitting in the very last row.

There was also no entertainment on board. Before taking our second flight we asked and checked if there was entertainment so we could prepare ourselves and buy magazine/books etc. The lady told us that each seat had a tablet style screen.

Upon arrival they scheduled me for a 6pm flight. At 5.45 American Airlines over-rode the airports authority and cancelled our flight, because they wanted more passengers from yet another rerouted plane catching my connection, except after making us wait an extra hour for them to make yet more money, the impending airport had a slight emergency. Had American thought of their passenger who booked months in advance, instead of stand-bys I would have made my trip in the scheduled 4hrs, instead of 18. They refused to re-fund any money.

IFE was AVOD and screen size and quality very good. Content was large and varied. Headphones were provided. WIFI was available, but too slow to be useful. A chicken couscous salad (or cheese ravioli) was served for dinner, which was very bland and bordering tasteless. Service by cabin crew was good and attentive.

In difference to my previous flight with UA a manned premium check in counter was offered as well. TSA in LAS relaxed and fast with basically no lines. LAS seems to be a well run and modern airport. Boarding as indicated and efficient. First segment to DFW was on a modern A321 with back seat screens and headphones for sale (5 USD). As usual for domestic flights in the U.S. drink service only, and some basic food choices plus alcoholic drinks for sale (overpriced and no cash accepted, so irrelevant). Flight packed, seats comfortable for Y and leg room good for Y due to main cabin extra. FA’s were professional, but nothing more. Departure almost on time and early arrival into DFW. All good for a domestic flight; a decent experience. DFW is an efficient airport to transit through and I incurred no problems. DFW-CRP on an old MD80; probably the very last time on this type of plane, as there are not many more in service. Kind of a nostalgic experience, as the DC9 was the first plane i was on as a child. Thanks to an upgrade in F a comfortable flight; old style recliner seats, which I find more comfortable than the newer models. The purser on this flight was exceptionally friendly, attentive and chatty. Drink service only, which is ok for a late evening one hour flight.

The rows of seats were not evenly spaced. Ours was particularly narrow making it difficult to even place or remove the carry on luggage under the seat. It was a very boring, uncomfortable flight.

Awful service in general; if what you are looking for is to have a bad time, wasting more than 8 hours in a max 3 hours flight, being stressed and not enjoying the holidays because of the incompetence of the airline personnel in core tasks such as showing up on time and sending your luggage to the correct address, this company is the way to go. You would think of this as a bad coincidence, but when they did the same thing to almost every single customer in the flight, you realize that the company should not be operating in such conditions because they are not following their part of the service. Unless you want to have a reference point of what the worst service possible can be, don't even bother in checking the cost of a flight with this company.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sacramento to Phoenix,December 2017,1,2,2,,1,1,no

First leg fine (Islip to Philadelphia), except for a really snarly, older flight attendant that acted like we were all cutting into her 'me' time. Just informed by the ticket agents at Philly that our 8:25 pm flight is delayed until 12:25 pm because they gave our crew to another delayed flight. Chaos ensued. Who wants to be in an airport all night? Well apparently the ticket agents missed the kindergarten a.m. vs. p.m. lesson.

She finally gave me a hotel voucher which was 14 miles away from the airport so I had to pay $45 taxi ride to a sketchy hotel. I will never fly American Airlines again.

I was able to cancel my flight and leave my tickets open in the hope that I could re-allocate my ex-husbands and still be able to take a vacation with my son this year. When it became apparent that I could not take a vacation this year I asked for some sort of a refund from American and cited my divorce as a cause and offered to send the notorized copies of my paperwork to them to prove what caused me to be unable to travel. American refused, saying that this is not an exception and I would get nothing in return and the tickets have to be used by those whose names appear on them. I can neither afford to travel, due to my divorce nor am I willing to contact my ex husband to offer him his ticket. American then said the matter would have no further correspondence.

American Airlines,1,G Scott,19th December 2017,"✅ Trip Verified | I fly AA moderately regularly between Philadelphia and San Diego. I often travel with surfboards and pay the $150 each way for this service ($200 internationally). However, AA takes no responsibility for damage to the surfboard even though I am effectively paying for an additional ticket to travel. I think this is completely messed up. This past trip I took a board out to my daughter that she built this past summer. It was packed exceptionally well. Wrapped in bubble wrap, covered in cardboard on all surfaces and more bubble wrap on the rails of the board and the whole thing put into a padded surfboard travel bag. Got it to San Diego and the rails were crushed in two places and there was a big heel dent in the bottom on the board. It was like the baggage handlers went out of their way to destroy the surfboard. OK, AA will pay the damages. Nope, the fine print says they are not responsible and they turn their backs. That's it. Game over. I hate AA big time. But there is no other choice.

American Airlines,5,Isabel Timothy,19th December 2017,"✅ Trip Verified | Montréal to Managua via Miami. I booked a return ticket online. The flight had a 24hr layover in Miami. I figured that my checked in luggage (which I paid 25$cad) would stay at the airport while I go sleep at a hotel near by. I still went to check at the baggage claim if it was there. So I saw my luggage, picked it up and went to the American Airline desk next to the baggage claim. The girl looked annoyed that I asked her why I got my luggage back if I’m flying again with them the next day. I said that I booked only 1 ticket and didn’t want to carry my luggage back and forth and especially not pay to check it in again. She replied rudely that it wasn’t her problem. I questioned her about what to do to solve my situation. She pointed upstairs and told me to ask someone up there. Without any directions to a certain desk. No “thank you” or any form of politeness. My time was running out to catch my hotel shuttle so I was in a hurry. Upstairs I only saw the regular AA check in counter where there was a huge lineup. Unfortunately I didn’t have enough time to make the line and I had to leave with much unnecessary luggage. It’s ridiculous to have to pay twice for luggage to get to my final destination. If I could have chosen a faster flight to Managua I would have done it to avoid this. The girls attitude was totally unprofessional. I don’t think AA really care about their customer service.

They told her they could not find her reservation and even though she had a boarding pass they still denied her. When I called AA to talk to someone about this issue I was told ""its in our records she was late for the flight.""

The flight to Philly was delayed twice for maintenance, the second time leading me to miss my connecting flight. It was then rescheduled and we switched planes. As soon as we all finished boarding the new plane, they made us get back off due to another maintenace issue even though they knew there was a problem before we boarded. I missed my new connecting flight! They then had to send us ON A BUS to make our new connecting flights, that had been changed 3 times at that point. The bus took us to the connecting airport (Philly), where we had to go back through TSA all over again and wait for a few hours for my flight to Orlando, which was my final destination. I was on vacation for 3.5 days, meeting my family in Disney, and by the time I got there I missed out on an entire days worth of activities/reservations. What a waste of money spent on booking this trip! Not to mention it was a waste of one of my very few vacation days that I was lucky to even get approved through work. I was originally to arrive in Orlando before noon, but I ended up getting there that night. This is not the first issue I've had with American Airlines at the Harrisburg airport. I can't even properly do all areas of this review because I wasn't even on a plane for my one ""flight"", I was on a bus!

That trip we were delayed 7 times, missed our connection flight, and were provided a hotel room which we were not given any direction on how to get to once we got off the plane and picked up our luggage. The staff was very rude to my wife and I and would not help us. We did get upgraded seats which was nice but that did not change my opinion or experience with American Airlines. The second trip was also an awful experience (Roundtrip from Detroit to New York). On our way home, our flight was delayed once and then later cancelled. I called customer service and tried to see what I needed to do to get another flight. I was about to lose service and told the customer service employee I would call him back because we are about to be disconnected. Before I could call back, the employee booked my wife and I to fly to Charlotte and then to Detroit 8 hours later. I called again and addressed this issue and the employee that time was helpful and told me to wait until I get to the airport to book or change my flight. I arrived at the airport in NY and changed my flight to land in Chicago and catch a connecting flight there to Detroit. We were delayed for over an hour trying to leave NY. Once we landed in Chicago, again we were delayed. Once on the plane, we were delayed again. The staff on the plane was not helpful and also the terminal staff was extremely rude to us.

When we got on the plane we noticed that the passenger next to us, flying with the same economy ticket had a carry on under his seat as big as the one that we just had to pay for! We spent $150 extra in baggage fees over the cost of 3 tickets that we will ask for a full refund for. The customer service was the worst that we have experienced in our many flight travels.

American Airlines,4,A Galiani,13th December 2017,✅ Trip Verified | Flew Charlotte - Frankfurt and return at the beginning of December. We opted to use frequent flyer miles so this was a good value in that respect. Both flights left on time and arrived slightly early and the pilots did a good job of alerting us to potential turbulence on the route. The seat back trays were dirty and flight attendants had nothing to clean them with but gave us napkins so we could wipe them ourselves. Seats were okay but no longer have adjustable headrests so not as comfortable as in the past. Cabin crew was what seems to be a typical mix on the legacy carriers - some were pleasant but some were decidedly cranky. Food service was minimal with small portions. Not a big deal for me as I don't tend to eat much on flights but big eaters would definitely be disappointed. Only one beverage service with the meal but drinks (water and juice) were set up in the rear galley so passengers could help themselves. IFE was disappointing. There appeared to be a decent number of options but the touchscreen was very unresponsive and required a lot of effort to move through the menu so I only watched movies and shows from the first page or so. The overall experience was okay and I appreciate the direct flight from North Carolina to Germany but American would not be my first choice for long haul economy as other airlines flying US to Frankfort seem to offer a nice experience.,A330-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte - Frankfurt,December 2017,2,2,2,1,3,4,yes
American Airlines,7,S Johnson,12th December 2017,"✅ Trip Verified | The aircraft appeared new, at least on the inside and was very clean. The flight was on time. We were given a pad to spread over the seat for sleeping along with the customary blanket and pillow. The seating is in the 1-2-1 configuration with the same controls and hardware that our Cathay Pacific flight had on the first leg of this trip (Los Angeles - Hong Kong), my wife and I had the two center seats. The business section began with row 4. We had access to Cathay Pacific's Bridge Lounge prior to the flight which was comfortable. It was a night flight (leaving at 7.40pm) so we were served dinner soon after lift-off. The meal was average, with a first course that was inedible (grilled cheese served ice cold and so dry it was difficult to cut or chew). I didn't see anyone eat that course-I wonder if AA gets any feedback on food selections that don't get eaten? The second course, scallops for us, was good enough to eat although nothing to look forward to. The flight crew was spotty in that some were attentive and efficient (in my wife's row) and some were harried, inefficient, and surly (my row). On the whole, the crew was nowhere as good and nice as those in the other airlines we flew this trip, which were all Asian airlines so perhaps it's not a fair comparison. Unfortunately, we had flown Cathay Pacific on the flight over to Asia which is a tough airline to compare to in regards to service although frankly any Asian airline we have flown has better flight crews (more service oriented and nicer) than American Airlines' crews. The Captain was informative as we waited to take off, which was nice. The entertainment options didn't include any recent quality movies although some quality older movies were offered (like ""Casablanca""). The crew didn't bother to ask passengers to open windows when we landed in LAX which made landing a bit less comfortable. All in all we were happily surprised with the seats and aircraft but suffered through the kind of service that is characteristic of AA in our experience. This plane did offer wifi although business passengers had to pay for it ($12 for 2 hours was the shortest plan). It took so long to pull up the wifi plan options I figured the service would be to slow and didn't buy it. Apparently AA sees wifi as an additional revenue opportunity rather than a way to enhance business class and make it more competitive with other airlines. We had flown AA on a similar flight returning from Asia a few years ago and it seemed to us that AA is trying to improve their business class and it is better than it was then. Unfortunately for AA in that market the Asia carriers are often as good as it gets in terms of flight crew service which continues to be AA's weak suit.",Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Hong Kong to Los Angeles,December 2017,5,2,2,2,4,3,no

Boarding was about 1 hour early. Orderly and smooth. Had seat 7A on the return. Second Business class cabin on board. Kind of Cozy. Seat 7A was excellent. Seemed like a lot more space, was not anchored with another passengers chair and comfortable enough that I slept for 7 hours... Flight attendants were attentive and friendly. Food service was ok. Taste of the seafood platter was bland, nothing to write home about. FA' came by often, but didn't ask if you'd like refills, just browsed by unless you asked.

You only need you boarding pass to show to the desk agent, to gain access. Must be a Business Class member or Ex Plat. Boarded early. Yes, an announcement is made in the club. Had seat 1L on the Boeing 787-8. I felt that it was kind of tight and the anchor was attached to seat 2L. Meaning you felt every movement of the other passenger. Although close to the galley for prompt service, kind of bothersome during the flight. Service was excellent. Food presentation and taste not so much. If you like a good cheese platter, you wont find it here, however, the attention to detail of the FA's very good. Plenty of current and classic DVD's to watch.

I sent a letter through the online form to customer relations. Customer relations called me back this morning and said that all they can do is waive the change fee ($200 per person) for future travel because it was a nonrefundable ticket. I asked to talk to someone else. He said there is no one else to talk to and no number I can call and nothing else can be done. This is a family emergency and that is all they can do? They didn't ask to see the doctors note or a history of injuries he has had. It is hard for me to believe that after choosing them over every other airlines, they can be so cold to us.

American Airlines,8,S Bewes,5th December 2017,"✅ Trip Verified | Charlotte to San Diego. This was a 5 hour flight and this was an ex US Airways A321. It did have the refurbished interior with new seat covers and carpets and overall a fresh clean cabin. But there were still no plugs, no IFE, just Wi Fi and GoGo movie streaming thru the American app (it actually worked very well, no issues at all and a decent selection of movies). But it makes no sense how they can put power ports on their 18 year old Ex US Air A319s but not a 3 year old Ex US Air A321. Nonetheless the seats were very comfortable with acceptable legroom and service was ok, FAs were average for a US airline, Flight left on time and arrived in San Diego 15 minutes early. Only thing I have to say is other than the red stripe on top of the seats the cabin was very very bland. Literally an all grey interior, grey bulkheads with no logos anywhere, grey and navy blue seats, grey carpet, practically all grey livery. Pretty dismal, also the cost for full Wi-Fi access is obnoxious. I bought a messsaging pass for 2 dollars which claimed it worked on skype but Skype said no internet, I could only use iMessage (no SMS) and I couldn't send pictures which was annoying because when I bought GoGo on US Airways in 2014 I could send and post pictures.

The flight was critical for us as we were flying from New York to Los Angeles to connect for our international flight back to Australia later the same day. The first inkling of a potential problem was the day before when I was unable to check in online, so spent hours at an AA office in Manhattan trying to resolve the issue. I was given various explanations but ultimately they accepted no responsibility, asserting that our travel agent in Australia had cancelled or voided the tickets. Again, at the check in counter on the day of the flight, the issue remained unresolved with a supervisor basically saying that our travel agent had ripped us off. We had no alternative but to purchase new tickets (fortunately, I had made a tentative booking the day before in case it was needed, otherwise we would have likely missed our LAX connection considering all flights were full). After returning home, AA repeated their conclusion after investigating the matter that our travel agent had cancelled our tickets which of course they denied so demanded further investigation. Weeks later, American Airlines admitted that the error was theirs all along and offered to reimburse the cost of the new tickets. There was also a gesture of compensation for our inconvenience - a $50 voucher towards another flight on American Airlines - of zero value to us in Australia. Overall, a very disappointing experience given the stress and inconvenience that resulted from their mistake. I would suggest that their staff receive improved training on dealing with such hopefully rare cases - being left in the lurch at a critical time by indifferent staff doesn't leave you with a great impression of an airline.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Los Angeles,October 2017,3,3,3,2,1,2,no

American Airlines,1,B Saunders,2nd December 2017,"✅ Trip Verified | This was easily the worst flight I've ever been on and it all comes down to the staff. To begin with, I was in a front row, exit row window seat in their 'economy plus' area. Being in an exit row you typically have to attest that you can step up to the plate if there's an emergency and be capable of doing so. The center seat in my row ended up with an extremely morbidly obese woman who was so large she was literally covering part of my body with her own. Her armpit was resting on my shoulder. The staff did not do anything about this situation. This is first and foremost a safety violation, secondly, I did not pay to be the armrest for another human being. This is unacceptable and the airline should have moved her, myself or made other arrangements for someone so large. When the flight attendant came around with dinner, I politely refused. She stood there, literally staring at me, and barked 'How'd I know you'd say that'? Well, I don't know ma'am - do you normally eat when a strangers armpit is grazing your cheek? Perhaps that's why I declined. When we were getting set to land at LHR we were put into a holding pattern. No biggie, this happens some times. However there was no communication from the captain or crew about how long this would be. Approximately a half hour into this wait I asked the flight attendant if she had any idea how long it would be. She stood in front of me, silently removed her scarf, adjusted it, retied it and then rolled her eyes at me and said ""Honey, this happens to every flight, every day at this airport"" - um, excuse me, it doesn't. I've flown into LHR 8 times in the last 10 months on British Airways and not once have we gone into a holding pattern. Not. Once. At any rate, as that didn't answer my question, I repeated my question. She said ""do you have a layover?"" I told her yes, but that it was a 2.5 hour layover so I wasn't concerned about that so much. I didn't want to scream that I was desperate to get out from under the armpit of the person next to me. She literally walked away saying we'd land soon enough. Not to mention, she left a garbage bag at the bulkhead that was kicked over frequently by people lining up for the toilet. She never once picked up the contents - I did - because I didn't want coffee/juice/whatever was in there staining my suede shoes. I literally purchased the in-fight wifi so I could write them a complaint in real-time. I've never been so fuming at an airline in my life! I'll give their wifi 2 stars since my email was successfully sent while still being squashed and poorly treated mid flight.

American Airlines,1,S Kurner,28th November 2017,"✅ Trip Verified | First of all, I would never have flown American Airlines had I had another choice. We fly Alaska Airlines 95% of the time as we have found their customer service superb and we live in the West Coast so it’s most convenient. At this time, however, there is no flight from Philly to Pitt on AK airlines so we booked a second itinerary on American. When we had originally checked in, they would not link our two separate itineraries even though Alaska Airlines did flying down. So we will have to get our bags from baggage claim and drop them, then go through the whole process of checking in our bags/security before our next leg of our long journey home. Apparently, American is undergoing ""budget cuts"" (literally, one of the gate attendants said this) and when you buy a ticket it’s not the same as buying a seat. So you have to pay extra to verify that you A) get a seat and B) get to sit with your party on the plane. Alaska Airlines does not ever make us do this. Again, the woman at the gate had deplorable customer service skills, very rude and curt. Not sympathetic or apologetic at all. She said to ""calm down"" even though I was obviously less than pleased but not acting out in any way. We almost weren’t going to get on our flight because they overbooked — are you surprised? Luckily, two passengers were willing to take a later flight for incentive allowing us to get on the plane. It seems that Americans Airlines is clearly struggling financially and in their professional development of staff. They might as well just close up shop because no one recommends flying on their airline anyway. If I pay $600 RT for a ticket from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh I expect to have a seat and be greeted with a smile. That should not be so much to ask. I have heard Alaska Airlines is adding a leg from Seattle to Pitt.

A trip the following month, my flight was delayed two hours, leaving passengers on the flight for an hour in their seats, first due to paperwork for maintenance that wasn't completed, then due to crew needing a break. I was hesitant to fly American again for my trip in November, but booked anyways giving it another chance. Arriving to the airport and waiting at my gate, the time came for boarding and my flight wasn't on the screen. I checked and the gate had been switched. I went to the new gate and they told me my gate was changed again. I went to the new gate again and they said that my flight was at the old gate, but that it had been delayed by an hour and a half without any reason.

American Airlines,3,Derek Northcutt,27th November 2017,"✅ Trip Verified | As always, am never disappointed at being continually disappointed by American Airlines. They have a new policy: they do not check luggage from one of their flights to another of their flights if it is on a separate reservation. If I had booked the tickets on the same passenger name record, it would have cost $2,000 more. American Airlines (along with UAL) seems to revel in seeing how much lower they can plumb the depths of customer service. Although I am platinum elite with this company, on this itinerary they tried twice to collect $25 for a checked bag onto an international flight for a Platinum member (two reasons why the checked luggage is free - want a third? I have an AA credit card). Then they tried to blame Alaska Airlines (a very bizarre attempt to shift responsibility). Delta checks luggage onto Air France and KLM and any other carrier they have a baggage agreement with, and so does UAL (even though I would avoid them because no one wants to be dragged off the airplane and beaten in the gate lobby). AA doesn't even have a ticketing/baggage agreement with AA anymore, so I guess not only are passengers blackballing the company but other airlines as well. In addition, with my platinum status I am supposed to have access to their lounges on international bookings. However, it was refused me this time b/c the connexions were extending past 24 hours even though every connexion was valid and legal. I spoke to a supervisor in the Admirals Club, but it seems AA doesn't empower any of its staff to make logical business decisions in order to serve the public. I was told I could pay $59 for a perquisite that is supposed to be gratis. By the time I made it over to the AA Eagle concourse at LAX, I was then within this 24-hour window and could use the lounge. Like I said, they seem to relish putting their thumbs in the eyes of the public, and I blame the airline companies in America (not in Europe where they are without exception gracious and hospitable to their passengers) for the increase in ""air rage"" incidents by always doing their best to enrage the public with their fees and poor service. This is not a problem in Europe where you are treated as a human being.

Rather than handling the situation before him diplomatically and with grace toward a valued traveler, he replied, ""well, if you really are Platinum Elite then you know you cannot change seats onboard."" The abrasiveness and discourtesy was so breathtaking I didn't pursue it further. When dealing with primitive people, it is best not to anger them.

The pilot came up to us and asked if there was a problem and I said yes they took our bags and said it wouldn’t have fit, there is plenty of room right here.

Both flights between SFO and MIA (# 931 and 967) were on a new-looking A321 with great AVOD and with smiley cabin crews that were constantly around and eager to help. There were two rounds of drinks and a cookie on these 6-hour flights; the optional food for sale was tasty but expensive. The flights between MIA and MVD (# 989 and 984) were on an old-looking B763 with archaic video screens on the ceiling, small overhead bins, and a mostly friendly and efficient cabin crew, though 1 or 2 of them looked like they didn’t want to be there (on # 984 they didn’t even distribute headphones for the movie or audio service unless passengers requested them) and a male attendant consistently skipped passengers during drink rounds and never acknowledged a “thank you”. The other attendants tried to make up for these slackers. On these 9-hour flights, a small but edible dinner was served 1 hour after departure, followed by a minimal breakfast 1 hour before landing.

So we planned an awesome trip to the Galapagos and made the mistake of purchasing plane tickets to Quito Ecuador on American Airlines. I made the horrible mistake of screwing the time up and arriving at the Denver airport with only 45 minutes before the plane was scheduled to leave. When we got to the ticket counter the American Airlines (AA) ticket agent told us that they closed acceptance for luggage 5 minutes ago, so they don't let us on our flight because of 5 minutes! This is where we really got shafted because we asked them to find us another flight to get to Quito and they did, but they gouged us for an extra $2500, which was $1500 more than the original cost of the tickets, we were furious, but with all the other reservations and time taken off work what could we do but let them take advantage of us, so we paid. The ironic rub to that flying out experience was the return flight from Quito, which AA delayed over 3 hours and only gave the excuse that it was ""legal"" issues. When I complained to them in an email they admitted that they didn't plan well enough in this computer age for a flight that had been scheduled for months to be able to have pilots that were rested enough to make that flight according to the FAA, so they held the flight until the pilots were legally rested. So this corporate giant wouldn't hold our outgoing flight 5 minutes so they could load our luggage, but they didn't mind messing up every passengers connecting flights on our return flight because of their own lazy planning.

Was seated 75m before offered a drink, and then 5m later before I'd even taken a sip my food was brought. I asked her to put it back into the oven until the happy hour was over. Flight from DFW - FCO also problematic. Had to ask two different staff how to put down the table. I had pre-ordered the duck and it was really awful, like what I'd imagine they'd serve in prison. Not a first class experience at all (I remember flying JFK - LHR on Pan Am and they carved meat for the meal right from the cart). An hour before the flight landed, I was asked to return my headphones so had no inflight entertainment last hour of flight. Why can they not do their housekeeping duties after all the passengers have left? They seem to have a checklist of duties to perform and they just want to rush through with no care for the inflight experience of the passengers. Quite a different attitude than from AF, KL, LH, OS, LX, or BA (even though BA is racing to the bottom to meet the service standards of Easy Jet and Ryan Air -- they charge £3 for a car of coca cola and there are no meals on board anymore). I returned on AA in Economy and had a better in-flight experience (the meal was good). Very disappointed and First Class costs $3,600 one-way I note.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,First Class,Santa Ana to Rome via Dallas,November 2017,4,2,1,4,3,1,no
American Airlines,1,Santosh Bhusal,12th November 2017,✅ Verified Review | San Diego to Pittsburgh via Philadelphia. I am sorry for the poor review I am going to give. The staffs at the check in and the gates were rude and unprofessional. They focussed on charging 50 dollars for a carry on item. I do not mind paying if that's the rule and did so graciously. What matters most is the way 'ill trained' staff treat you. Sorry American Airlines. It used to be one of highly professional flights a few years ago. Good luck in recuperating the business.

We asked the flight attendant to assist us to deplane as we needed to catch a connecting flight to Austin at 7.43. She said we have plenty of time and she can't do anything to help us. We ran to our gate which was all the way on the other end of the terminal. PHX airport is massive and it took us 20+ minute sprinting to our gate. If anyone who knows PHX airport, we went from gate A23 to gate B26. Got the our gate at 7.40 but the plane had closed it doors. Apparently the gate agent let the gate closed without us. They didn't even call or announce our name. So we end up paying for our hotel and got a standby ticket for the following day. Never again. This will be my last trip with this airline.

American Airlines,7,Jaret Rapp,9th November 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Flew Las Vegas to Miami. American Airlines is usually one of my last airlines of choice. But in this case, price and schedule left me no choice, so AA it was. While they continue to try to find ways to cram more people on their planes, and seating is definitely tight, in this case, since it was a red eye, I fortunately managed to sleep through the flight despite being not very comfortable. The flight left on time and arrived a little early and I mostly slept through it, so I guess that's a win! The A321 had inflight entertainment provided via ones own device and wifi. I did not attempt to use it. One thing about AA and MIA is there is a very long walk from the terminal to where the baggage claim is and it took maybe 15 more minutes after this walk before luggage arrived. In this case, the price of the flight was good, I got to my destination safely on time, and I slept through the flight. However, I still do not like American and only chose them when I do not have another choice as they are the dominant carrier out of Miami.",A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Miami,November 2017,1,4,,,3,4,no

I am on the plane as we speak to fly from Toronto to New York LaGuardia. Just got a notification that the plane will not depart until 07.30 as opposed to the 06.30 scheduled time. And to be quite honest, I already wasn’t too pleased by the counter staff at YYZ. They were extremely slow and did not seem very motivated to do their job. Seemed liked they were taking their sweet old time despite the long line up. I’ve never experienced anything so slow when travelling with other airlines. Another gentleman in the line also complained how slow the check in staff were. Now in terms of the flight delay, the pilot stated that there were mechanical issues that needed to be looked at and that the issue was not too serious. Well this obviously makes me nervous.

American Airlines,1,N Dallon,6th November 2017,✅ Verified Review | Sacramento to Scranton Wilkes-Barre. The nightmare started in Sacramento. We took a 1.5 hour delay for a door assist bottle being 500 psi to low for dispatch. I'm a licensed aircraft mechanic myself. So I can tell you with absolute certainty that this is part of a daily check by the flight attendants as well as maintenance. They waited until the airplane was fully boarded before someone noticed. This is avoidable if there maintenance department/flight attendants were doing there job. Since I took the delay on this flight it screwed up the rest of my trip. I missed the next connecting flight. Ended up waiting for hours until I was able to depart. Oh wait now I have an extra stop! I get to Philadelphia and this flight takes a 75 minute delay.

I asked for my complimentary cookie and they both acted as though we were stealing from them. Then I asked for coffee and she asked the other attendant - 'what does she want' in a ugly manner. Then she slammed the sugar on the tray. I cannot believe attendants are able to treat people this way.

American Airlines,9,M Ferris,2nd November 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I took American Airlines AA109 flight LHR-LAX (Economy) just over a month ago. And let me tell you, it was nice: you left the plane with a great feeling rather than a standard one! While it is hard to describe what exactly went so well, I will try - the crew: this was probably most important. The crew was very nice and helpful throughout the flight. They brought more water all the time (very important on planes) and was just always there when you needed something. They would also take your trash with them, even when they were just passing by. Some were a little bit stressed toward the end of the flight but that was ok since they were working hard. This was especially obvious after I took my flight back with Iberia from MIA-MAD where it took them a full 2.5 hrs after takeoff to serve drinks for the first time. It was an overnight flight and people wanted to use the time to sleep. I snagged a main cabin extra seat for free using my status, so I had additional legroom, that was great! Also the lavatories were still very clean, even after 11.5 hrs of flight. As we all know, economy class food isn’t especially known for its quality. What we had though, was very good for economy. It was fried chicken in Chinese sweet sauce or something with rice. The sides were fine, as was the breakfast. I was really impressed. (Dinner was also tasty on Iberia but the breakfast was just average I’d say). In the rear part of the plane, the crew had two nice sets of snacks and soft drinks for everyone to have as much as they’d like. They also constantly refilled everything and you could ever ask them for other things they didn’t put out there. Also, they would talk to passengers, it was like a place to socialize! Really amazing for economy. The only thing I didn’t enjoy so much was the temperature. While it was ok for lots of people, I often think it’s a lil bit cold on the planes but the crew assured me, they would turn the heating up a bit for me. Didn’t help so much after all, but that’s ok. As you can see, American Airlines is not as bad as lots of people say.

This is the second time in two months in which my flight has been cancelled. Granted this past experience was due to weather, but the rebooking process has been painful and a full day delayed. Good thing I work for a company that is flexible and didn’t need to take a vacation day due to this. The first time it happened, I drove overnight to reach my destination in time - American was useless in even trying to look through other airlines.

American Airlines,8,S Robinson,31st October 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Flew American Airlines from Dallas Fort Worth - London Heathrow in C on a B777-300. Arrived from a domestic flight and transfer in DFW hassle-free, but involved an (easy) change of terminals. DFW is probably one the very best transfer airports in the U.S. AAdmirals Club in DFW was nicer than others I have been to, but offerings very minimal and sub-par for an international flight. Food and ""premium"" drinks for purchase at steep airport prices. Coffee/tea, soft drinks for free. Basic beer and wine available from a manned bar (this is the U.S., so ""free"" means ""for tips""). WIFI was reliable. Overall, definitely not comparable to the lounge experience offered by non U.S.-based airlines. Boarding fairly orderly and cabin crew good and friendly. Seats in C are in a herringbone 1-2-1 configuration. Same seats as CX and these are one of the best seats in C for space and comfort. IFE was AVOD, selection good, Bose headphones supplied, screen not very responsive, but visually good. However, irritating ads before every selection, that could not be skipped or fast forwarded. Dinner (chose the quinoa crusted prawns) was actually tasty on this flight and quality in line what I would expect in transatlantic business class. It was a night flight, so tray service, but service did not feel rushed just to get it over with. Drinks selection good as well and with regular top ups. New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc was a good choice. Slept thru breakfast, so cannot comment on it, but FA’s offered to bring some coffee just before landing, which was much appreciated. Catering out of AA’s hub in DFW seems to be superior to that out of other locations. Cabin crew professional, obviously experienced and good, even friendly. On-time departure and on time arrival (more or less). Good experience and nothing to complain about. Comparing to other carriers I have used in C over the Atlantic: as for Oneworld alternatives AA is way ahead of BA (especially due to seating arrangement on AA’s B777-300 vs. BA’s high density 2-4-2 seating), probably in line with AY, but not quite on the level of IB. Also, I would rate the overall experience on Star Alliance’s OS and LX higher, but again AA did good on this flight. Recommended, if you are on B777-300 (seating can be much inferior on other planes types).",Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Dallas Fort Worth - London Heathrow,November 2016,5,5,5,5,3,4,yes

I have dealt with issues since booking my flights for my honeymoon. The customer service is horrible! The first issue I dealt with when booking was over the phone. We wanted to switch our flights to a different time so we wouldn’t miss our cruise ship. The flight we had originally booked was cutting it close. Ended up finding another flight (price was less than we paid) when we went to change the flights I had to deal with about 15 different people trying to tell me that I needed to pay more money for switching the flight. After days and numerous people we ended up just booking and paying the extra money. Be careful because if you go On the site and show that you’re looking at a flight the price will raise from when you first looked at it. Next issue was coming home we arrived to the Miami airport. Checking into the flight the day before we got on our boarding passes a certain area to board. When we got to the airport, they changed the gate again and gave us paper boarding passes, then it got close to boarding time and we realized no one was boarding. So I looked on the app and it gave us another area so we rushed there realizing that was also the wrong gate. Our gate for changed 4 different times without being notified. So we ended up Missing our flight. The gate was on the other side of the airport. When talking to the customer service about switching our flight they were very rude telling us that their was nothing they could do and it was our fault that we didn’t know.

American Airlines,2,R Johnson,28th October 2017,"✅ Verified Review | After a 24-hour journey home to Toronto from South Africa, the last leg of my trip was on American Airlines out of Chicago. As I settled into my seat, I watched my luggage being loaded on the plane parked next to me. I alerted the flight attendant, who quickly reached out to the supervisor to intervene. After much discussion and delay, I finally saw the baggage handlers walk my suitcase over to the stairs of our gangway. Eureka! I saved myself the extra hassle of recovering my luggage after Qatar so skillfully and autonomously managed several potential baggage issues on the other legs of my trip, or so you would think. Even though I was able to intervene enough to get my suitcase to the door of the plane, it actually never made it inside. Whatever happened at that moment saw my luggage delayed until the next flight, 2 hours later. Not impressed by the 'we-don't-really-care-about-you-or-your-luggage' attitude.

American Airlines,1,R Saunders Maziarz,28th October 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I have never had a good experience with American Airlines. And I just now had another bad one where I wasted an hour and a half on the phone trying to get a flight reserved. American Airlines is almost always late in my experience and their lateness last July caused us to miss our connecting flight. Just because it was with another airline, also terrible, I had to pay full, walk-in price for tickets because of American Airlines inability to be on time. I complained and got a ridiculous $25 voucher which I can't even use except in the U.S. Why all this penny-pinching when airlines are profiting off us like crazy? And we all know it.

American Airlines,1,K Irving,26th October 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I have flown with Delta multiple times as well as Southwest. First of all, I can almost assure you 95% of the employees there get paid to not care about their jobs. When I arrived 25 mins before boarding time, I had to get a different flight. Employee neglected to let me know there were standby flights available. When I was leaving Nashville, I was 33 minutes before boarding time and was still considered ""late"", this lady only let me know the standby option. Clearly the employees are clueless about their jobs and have no sympathy whatsoever. I've never sat in such a tiny seat, I felt absolutely trapped and terrible on only an hour and a half plane ride. When I got on standby the guy at the podium let me know I was the second name to be called. After several names being called, I was the last one along with two other men. They made me walk all the way to the airplane door just to let me know they had miscounted the seats and were fine with sending me away. As I waited for the next standby flight, the lady took forever and continued to do other things while I was sitting right in front of her. Then said the next standby was at another gate, to get in line for 10 mins and wait for them to announce a gate change. I went to the different gate that they announced just for the employees to look at me because they werent ready for that flight yet. The neglect and ignorance of this company is unreal. Not only did I pay $300+ for some stupid flights with layovers just to pay $75 extra because of an undereducated worker. I've never ridden such a terribly serviced plane.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Dallas then San Antonio,October 2017,1,1,1,,1,1,no

American Airlines,1,D Shearer,25th October 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Los Angeles to Phoenix. I purchased the new American Airlines Economy class ticket. Little did I know what that really entailed. I pay $25 for my carry on luggage and head to the gate 2 hours early. My boarding group was Group 9. As they call each group, I walk closer and closer to the gate. At Group 7, they close the gate. I was standing there with 8 other people in Group 9 and the man walks up to us and tells us the gate is closed. They never called last boarding, and never called our group! We were told we were ""late"". We were sent to customer service. As I walked up to customer service, the women closed the rope on me and told me she was off duty and someone else will show up. The Manager arrives and continues to tell me and the 8 other passengers that it was our fault that we were late to the gate and that was why they left without us. Customer service tells me she will place us on standby for the next flight. We get on the bus to the next terminal and race to catch the next flight. When I get there, the person at the desk tells me that I will not be getting on the flight. Customer service sent all of us to another terminal to catch a flight she knew we would never get on! As I try to explain to the man what happened, he shuts me up and tells me there is nothing he can do. I raise my voice out of frustration and he calls the security to tell me to leave the terminal right away. I leave the airport and head to the main check in. I tell them my story and she tells me that she will put me on the next flight in the morning and I will make that flight. I Uber home and wake up at 3AM to catch the 5:30 AM flight. I'm the last to be called for the standby and I start boarding the plan. the women stops me as I'm walking onto the plane and tells me I have to get off and there is no more room. Not even an apology, nothing. Grabs my arm and tells me I have to get off there is no more room. Tells me I have to stand in line and wait to find out if I can get on the next one. I get told I will not get on the next flight. I ended up renting a car and driving to PHX. When I went to baggage claim, the women was very nice and asked what had happened in LAX with those flights because there seemed to be many other people with my same problem who had to end up driving.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Phoenix,October 2017,,,,,2,1,no

Comfortable seat with plenty of legroom despite a fixed wall in front. Nice video screen with plenty of option to pass on the time on a quick 3 hour flight. Flight attendants this morning were ever present and filled out several drink orders with a smile and some humor. Did not purchase any food, as we had a light breakfast in the Admirals Club before boarding. Flight was comfortable enough and on time, thankfully as we had only a 45 minute connection in LAX. Connection to LAS was on a B738. The gate area was chaotic, however boarding was on time and efficient. 2nd row in MCE had plenty of legroom for he 46 minute flight to LAS.

American Airlines,1,C Kean,24th October 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Chicago to Indianapolis. There’s a reason American Airlines is not my preferred carrier and today’s experience served to push them much further down the list. Traveling with the same baggage I carried a week earlier on United, American decided that gouging $25 to check a bag wasn’t insult enough; they forced me to check a second bag for an outrageous $35 more. United charged quite enough at $25.

When I asked to prolong this credit (which was my own money and then cancelled with a free £200 for them), they refused to even prolong the one year lifespan of my refund. And this all comes after my extended patience with their utterly incompetent services, purchasing tickets for my crew members and all.

All of the flights never departed on time making me nearly miss both connecting flights. American Airlines is so untimely. Instead of a seven hour trip home, it became thirteen hours with all the delays. Despite passengers being being seated for a long time. I will never again fly with this airline for how unprofessional and inconsiderate they are to their customers. I paid more for my flights through this airline than I do at cheaper airlines, like Spirit and Southwest. Spirit and Southwest gave me 100% better service.

American Airlines,7,C Walker,23rd October 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Auckland to Boston via Los Angeles. There are two options to get from direct from NZ to the US, United or American (Air NZ & QANTAS flights are operated by those airlines too). American were slightly cheaper so I picked them and I was very pleasantly surprised. Check in was a breeze, and the crew were well presented and welcoming. Throughout the flight they were polite, friendly and attentive. Best of all they had personality and chatted happily with passengers. The food was nice and just the right amount to be full but not bloated. Inflight entertainment selection was really good. Leg room and seat width were fine for me (average height and build). Just take your own headphones as they only give out ear buds. So overall the Auckland to LA flight was excellent value for money and I'd fly American again to get to the US. I had concerns about my short layover in LA, only 2 hours to clear customs and security and get to the Boston flight. I needn't have worried, LAX do it right. They had an Express Connection pass waiting for all passengers connecting within 2 hours which meant I skipped a lot of queues. They had staff at multiple points to direct passengers, so I made it to my next flight an hour after getting off the first one, and had time to grab a coffee. LA to Boston flight was well organised, left on time, the crew were fine and I'd happily do this flight again too. Again, bring your own headphones. The inflight entertainment was available, but they don't give out headphones.

I was prior active duty Army, and now I’m a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now.

We check in at the personal check in because we are flying as a family and I have car seats. They took care of us exceptionally well as I asked them to change/arrange seats so my wife could sit with one kid and I could sit with another kid, no problem then we went through security. However on the way back I was directed to the kiosk checking only and I got annoyed because I wanted to check in with a person so we could change our seats. They refused and said I had to use the kiosk no exceptions. They said I had to go upstairs after security at the actual gate. So I went up there and asked them to arrange the seats so each parent could sit with a kid but they said the flight was full and they could not change seats. I told them my departure flight was the same way and they were able to change my seats but the person refused to do so. So I got mad and just left and let it be. I am writing to complain about American Airlines staff at LAX airport and their very unreasonable accommodation for family and kids traveling abroad. DFW seems to accommodate just fine but LAX is not so accommodating. This is just my experience and not representing all passengers.

We were told we would have to return to the gate, which took another 45 minutes. The entire flight would have taken 1.5 hours, we spent more than twice that time on the hot airplane! Their reasoning for not taking off was that they didn’t want us to be uncomfortable! We are deplaning now, this story is not yet over.

The lack of compassion and customer service from America Airlines is shocking and disappointing to say the least. I will check reviews prior to booking my next flight.

The tickets are much more expensive than their competitors (Southwest, etc) and there is less room for seating and less room for carry-ons to be stowed above. The overhead storage space is so limited that I had to check a carry-on I brought, which may cause fragile items to be damaged. When asked about why I would have to check this, the female attendant spoke with an extremely annoyed and sarcastic tone telling me “well that’s too bad, you can take a seat and book another flight”.

They put us up at a hotel and gave us each $20 for dinner, breakfast, and lunch. Breakfast alone was $23 per person plus tax for a buffet so you can imagine how much lunch and dinner was. The hotel AA put us in said AA overbooks and bumps people often! Not to mention the extra money we had to pay for pet sitters and time missed from work coming back over 24 hours late.

I sit here at gate D25, waiting to board a flight I shouldn’t be on, more frustrated than I’ve ever been with an airline. I’ve had one bad experience after another with American Airlines. I arrive to gate T9 around 5am and immediately go to the check in desk because I’m flying Basic Economy for the first time so I want the gate agents to know that I’m here and would like a seat number for the flight. One rudely responds, “We’ll call your name when we’re ready for that.” I sit down patiently waiting for my name. Finally my name is called, and she asks me if my small duffel bag is the only bag I have? I respond that yes it is. Another agent chimes in that it looks like it it is too big and that I will have to pay for it. I respond that it should fit under my seat, so I put it in the demonstration bin and of course it fits. They tell me they just wanted to see my bags and that I can sit back down and wait for the next instruction. When it comes time for boarding group 9 to board, I wait for my name to be called. (now apparently there are two individuals with my last name, and the other individual is flying standby. But I don’t find this out until later.) they ask the group to walk with them down the runway and wait for a seat number. I ask the agent when I can board since I paid for a ticket, she asks the other agent about me who checks her list and says that “You’re not on my list!” They give up all seats on the flight and I have now missed my flight. We get back to the desk at which point I’ve never had two grown women be so disrespectful to me. They both blamed me for not getting on the flight. Saying the flight had two Individuals with my last name but not once did they call a first name. I now know that neither Individual with my last name made the flight.

My flight was delayed due to non weather related issues from Houston to Charlotte (layover) to the extent there flight was cancelled. So I would be stuck in Charlotte. I had to rent a car and drive to Augustaand then drive back to Charlotte to fly home. My flight was again delayed and I had to stay the night (again non weather related). I finally arrive in Houston Monday morning and low and behold my luggage is delayed on another flight! So I'm late for work, I'm out hundreds of dollars, I do not have my luggage and I am beyond upset! I call and they issue a refund of $96.72. What the heck did that cover! Every time I fly American there are issues. Save yourself time and money and fly with anyone else! Also I paid for the wifi service during the flight and I should have known - it didn't work either. The onboard staff was rude and hasty. They cared more about advertising for their credit card and passing out applications then they did the passengers!

The aircraft broke down and needed to be replaced. The flight was the best part of 5 hours late. Inflight service and ground handling was ordinary. Once upon a time America lead the world with customer service. American Airlines staff seemed to be so demotivated that they really have little interest in their customers. The whole lack of a service culture seems to filter through the airline. They just don't care.

My flight from Dulles was delayed 45 minutes due to a circuit board issue. Once we finally arrived at Dallas, we had to wait around 30 minutes on the runway because there was a plane at our terminal. Once we finally got off the plane I had 10 minutes to get to my next flight so the stewardess directed me to an AA desk to get another flight. The desk of 3 American Airlines worker had no one at their gate or desk so the stewardess left me their for the 3 girls to help me. The 3 workers never looked up from their desk, and when I finally got them to acknowledge me they said they couldn’t help me because they were busy preparing for an international flight that left in 5 hours! I asked them to at least see if my flight had done last call. They refused saying “we don’t have all the time in the world to help people that aren’t on this flight”. Again, that flight didn’t leave for 5 hours and there were 3 workers! I finally made it down to my gate and spoke with customer assistance. The 3 workers there were all on their cell phones, which they didn’t put down when I arrived for help. I explain the situation and also told them I was shocked by the lack of customer service I received at the other desk. 2 of the workers giggles and rolled their eyes while on their cell phones. The gentleman helping respond, “there are more customer that missed their flight than just you, those workers have to managed many customer with specific need, this desk has all the time in the world though. I have you on a new flight, have a nice day”. I’m happy the gentleman was more “welcoming” than the other 5 customer service workers but I can honestly say this is the worst airline customer service I have experienced from any airline company.

Other things they told us were ""perks"": check in luggage ($25 extra each), overhead storage (not allowed), 1 carry on or personal item only (to be stored under the seat only), and the seat itself! Yes she actually said the seat is a pen and would be extra! After all that they wouldn't even seat me with my wife. We were close - 15 rows away! Currently waiting to board in 2 hours.

I was not late and had to wait for the gate to open once I got there using no express line. The flight attendants on the way to New York were nice, but the airplane was just something out of the 90s. No private screen (which is standard for British, United, Lufthansa, Swiss), no way to control the air conditioning (it was freezing cold), the audio from the audio jack was not working well and the seat pocket was a little broken. On the way back, the cabin crew, and particularly one flight attendant, was just so rude I could not believe my ears. I was asked if I wanted to change seats because I was seated close to the restrooms in the back and when I politely declined explaining that I wasn’t feeling very well and wanted to stay close to the restroom I got a ""yeah, whatever!"" as a response while she walked away.

Passengers from a flight to Miami, cancelled only that day, were given seats ahead of me! After a harrowing 3 hour wait, I was given one of the last seats just as the plane commenced boarding. Check in staff were very very slow. Not sure what the problem was but it took an hour for me to reach the front of a 10 person queue with 3 counters open. Onboard staff were also quite rude - they appear to hate their jobs and certainly the passengers! Abrupt, unresponsive.

Instead of appreciating our business and apologising for the inconvinience of being delayed (once again, this is my 17th delayed flight in the last few months) the employees got defensive, rude and disruptive.

American Airlines,1,T Carben,16th September 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Seattle to Quito via Dallas. For about a year, we planned a trip to the Galapagos and Machu Picchu, and bought round trip airline tickets on American Airlines. The night before our flight (flight departing morning of 8/5/17), we printed boarding passes. At approximately 10PM we received a non-urgent email from American stating: please call to rebook your flight. No other info given. We almost overlooked the email because of the lack of urgency and the fact that we already had our boarding passes. When we called we were informed our entire trip to Equador was cancelled due to ground conditions. I called both airports we would be landing at and they reported no delays or ground conditions. American Airlines would not tell us what the ground conditions were. The night they cancelled, American Airlines only offered to move us to a flight on American leaving 48 hours later which would not get us to our destination for 4 days. (Our original flight would get us there in just over 24 hours.) They would not put us on a flight with another airline, which were available. They did not apologize and treated us like we were wasting there time. We were told we would not be given any compensation for the loss of 4 days of our trip. I called other airlines myself, in the middle of the night, and booked us on Delta (for flights that would get us to our destination on time,) but had to pay $4500 out of pocket. Delta got us to our destination on time and with no ground condition delays. We landed at the same time our original flight was scheduled to land. Upon return from our trip, we tried to contact customer relations at American to get a refund. There was no phone number, so we wrote an email and waited for a call. A day later, a representative notified us we would be getting no compensation for our losses. She gave a cursory ""I apologize for your inconvenience"" She gave us no further support and would not transfer us to a superior. She actually rose her voice with us when we asked to speak to someone else and said she had the authority to make these decisions. There are no phone numbers for customer service, refunds, or managers. Approximately 1 month after our cancelled flight, we finally received a refund of $1680 for the cost of the flight that was cancelled, but we were not compensated for the $4500 we lost. We felt that each person we talked to was unhelpful and even rude at times. We understand that flights can get cancelled but expect to be helped onto another flight in a timely manner or compensated for our losses. At the very least we should have an explanation of why our trip was cancelled.

I spent 17 hours at different airports all do to with American Airlines problems. Starting my flights in Salisbury, MD. Supposed to have a connection in Charlotte, then on to Fort Lauderdale. The first flight being overbooked. Thinking I was helping out the airline, I accepted a 300 dollar voucher and rebooked on a flight that should have gotten me into Fort Lauderdale earlier than my original flight. Now the fun starts, arriving at the first airport at 5am and finally getting to my destination 17 hours later. The first flight of the day was overbooked. The 2nd flight was delayed due to mechanical problems causing me to miss my connection because of the delayed flight. Since I missed my connection American Airlines tried to find another flight for me, the next flight they offered was almost 10 hours hanging out in the Philadelphia airport before taking off. Then they found a different flight leaving about 3 hours later with another connection in Charlotte. When we arrived in Charlotte, the American Airlines gate area was a total mad house. People standing everywhere up against each other and people sitting on the floor, because of American Airlines problems. It felt like there was no air conditioning, because of all the people in a small area. They were all talking on the microphones at the same time, mentioning delays and offering 900 dollars or more for giving up flights. Now the connecting flight in Charlotte then was delayed several times. Because of all the problems with American Airlines, I missed a lunch and dinner. Also a friend had to rent a 2nd car, because I was the one with the car rental for the trip. Once I got home a few days later I contacted American Airlines and explained the situation, and to let them know I was not pleased.

American Airlines,1,S Harker,4th September 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Philadelphia. They told us they had a problem in the system, so we would have to wait a little - which I didn't have a problem with. Then they went on and on and kept on delaying the expected departure time. And after 2 whole hours of sitting on the plane, they told us we would have to go outside in the boarding area and wait. At this point I was a little annoyed, but not mad. After that, they made us wait 3 more hours outside in the boarding area, with little to no help from the staff on when we were going to leave, before they told us the whole flight had been cancelled. I was going to miss a whole day of seminars that I had to attend. Then I was like its okay, mistakes happen, and then rebooked the flight for the next morning at 6AM since they had no more available flights on that day. I got back home at around 2, so I had been there for about 8 hours. The next day I was on my way to the airport when I got a text message that my 6AM flight had been cancelled too. At this point I was furious. It was not even a weather related issue, it was because of American Airline's lack of preperation ahead of a flight, in which they always seem to have problems with their system. I had to call their customer service an try to rebook, since I had to get to Philly as soon as I could. The staff on the phone were horrible, first they said there were no more flights availble on that day to philly, (In which there were because I could literally see that there were available flights - I was looking at it on my phone when I was talking to them). Then I asked them if they could switch me to another airline, in which they said that it was not possible. I hung up the call out of frustration, and called them back a few minutes later, this time someone else picked up. I asked him the same question I asked the other guy, that if they could switch me to another airline. This time, the answer was different. He said he could switch me over to united. I was shocked, because the other guy told me they could not do that. The united flight was later in that day, so by then the program I was going to attend in Philly would be over, so I decided to ask for a refund. I had to scream at the guy to let me get a refund because he was refusing to give it to me for ""privacy"" purposes, which didn't make sense at all. Even after all that I went through, I could not understand how someone could not give someone their money back. After about an hour of yelling and convincing, he finally gave me a refund.

My flight was delayed in Atlanta and started at 7:30pm and my connection was missed in Charlotte at 8pm. When I requested customer service they allocated me for 10:30pm flight and the last minute they said pilot was unavailable so flight delayed to 2am. At 1:30am aa representative came told that flight was cancelled.. and they are very rude and helpful when I asked for the reason. And next day they have asked me to come to airport by 8 so that they can allocate me on 9:30AM flight. When I came to airport they said flight was full they can't accommodate.. they said they will allocate me 12:30 pm flight it was also delayed till 3pm because of unavailability of pilots. And they were unable to allocate a seat in that flight also.. when I asked for the reason they said your name was not showed up and their behavior is very rude. This is my second time travel in American Airlines and two times faced the same issue. These people don't understand the situation.

American Airlines,3,G Harfoune,2nd September 2017,"✅ Verified Review | London Heathrow to New York JFK. Boarding was OK. Was feeling a little thirsty before take off and asked one of the cabin crew members for water. It was the most unpleasant exchange I have had with an airline staff. The conversation went: Me: excuse me, can I have a glass of water please? Airline staff (male): what's that? He asked the question in a very rude manner and looked visibly annoyed that I was asking him something. I would have expected something along the lines of: ""I'm sorry mam, I did not hear you."" In any case, I repeated my question. Me: Can I have a glass of water please? Airline staff: Well we're about to take off so I can't. I did not catch the rest of his answer because as he started responding he simply turned around and continued talking as if he wasn't talking to me - all this in a very rude and angry tone. I thought to myself I'm only asking for a glass of water and if indeed it is not possible now, the correct and polite answer would have been: ""I'm sorry mam, but unfortunately we are about to take off so it is not possible right now. We'll bring you a glass after take off."" For someone who travels quite a lot with major airlines and have platinum level with some airline mileage programmes, I was quite shocked because this is really the lowest in terms of the quality of in-flight personnel.

I fly instead of taking the bus so that I can save time and cut the long traveling time. And that's why I am even ready to spend more dollars. But American Airlines flights are always delayed for more than an hour. And it happened to me not just once but 4 or 5 times. Once, my flight was delayed by 5 hours. Typically it is a 45min. flight from Boston to Philadelphia. And the bus takes about 7 hours. But when I fly with American Airlines, the travel time is almost similar to a bus journey. They always have maintainance issue with their flights and I always end up spending 1-2 hours in the airport or flight, waiting for it to take off. And they never compensate for this delay in anyway.

Yet the plane is still sitting at the terminal. Not to mention this is the last flight out of this terminal and the last one coming in. I know as I stayed there till 1am trying to get my problem solved with them. No one in customer services actually knows what that is at Dallas Fort Worth airport. Rude and care nothing about their customers. The best part is when we got to customer service they had three people working. When a line started up 2 of those 3 people just left. Leaving one person to deal with everything. Then when you ask to speak to a manager. They make you wait an hour until a flight attendant shows you were they are one gate over. As you stand there waiting to speak with them. They act like you are not even there. Typing away on the computer until you do something to really get the attention of them. Then they say well you can fly out tomorrow at 7.30 but we can do nothing else. So you call a 800 number and they tell you how they should pay for your hotel, food for the night/breakfast and get you to and from the airport/hotel and back. So I missed a 8.20pm flight and finally got to a hotel at 12.45am. Best part was we had 8 other people in the same boat. 2 from my flight and the rest were different flights.

My mom had also been hospitalized after learning of the death, so I just wanted to get home asap. I called American Airlines to help change our plans for an emergency flight home, and the woman who helped us was so kind and patient as we were still reeling from the news and trying to make a decision whether to take an early flight with a layover or take one in the afternoon. They waived change fees that would have been over $400 and just charged us less than $20 for the difference in the ticket costs. The woman from American Airlines handled everything, and got us home at the earliest possible time we could get out. We are inexperienced fliers and have never had a transfer. The ticket agents helped us figure everything out.

When I came to pick up the car at the PMI airport, the teller did not recognize the voucher and prompted me to provide my credit card. At first I thought it was only for incidentals but at the end of my trip, they charged my card in full ($274). I only realized this after I arrived back home. I contacted American Airlines and informed them of the issue. They acknowledged that Avis (the rental car company) made a mistake and that they would facilitate a refund of my miles. After a few days passing, I did not hear back from American Airlines nor did I see the miles credit back on my AAdvantage account. I followed-up with American Airlines. A representative responded to my inquiry and informed me that there is nothing they can do. I repeatedly inquired to escalate this issue to the supervisor. He claimed he was a supervisor and said there was nothing they can do. In short, I spent 28,800 and $274 for a mini-car for 6 days. Is this fair? I think not.

I received a response denying the refund stating ""she was still properly escorted for the entirety of her travel while on board and in the airports."" They also let me know they were logging this into their 'sophisticated database"" so leaders can review it. I addition, to make the reservation one has to call AA.

First we have a 4 hour delay in Charleston, because apparently the air conditioning on the plane wasn't working. Then after 2 hours trying to fix it they finally assign another plane to come pick us up in Charleston from Charlotte, NC. This delay causes us to miss our connecting flight and bumps our departure to tomorrow morning (or so we thought). Upon arrival in Charlotte, we find out that our flight to Des Moines was delayed too allowing us to make the flight however it was too late, they sold our seats and we couldn't get on the flight despite being on that flight to begin with. This experience caused me to miss a critical business meeting. I've had nothing but poor experiences with American and it's frustrating to yet again be stuck in a connecting city when it turns out I was on time for the flight anyhow. Thanks for selling the seat that was mine and bumping me to the following day. Come to find out while mingling with a frequent traveler departing Charleston, this is a regular occurrence and this plane frequently has mechanical delays. Take the time to service your equipment.

The flight attendants' uniforms looked as though they had slept in when we boarded the plane. This was the most class-less First Class. The air quality was also poor. There was a strange smell when we got on, and it did not dissipate. You could choose to close air vents or endure cold air blasting down on your head.

Lady made no real effort to get me on the plane. Just cited the rules. Meanwhile I could see plane sitting there. Clearly could have helped if she tried.

American Airlines,1,S Hatten,11th August 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Los Angeles to Shanghai PVG. I just encountered the absolute worst check-in and security I have ever experienced. We were at the American Airlines terminal at LAX. They insisted we checked in using machines, none of which worked for us. When we went to a desk the lady behind the encounter was rude and accused us of using the machines incorrectly. We were given seats not next to each other for our 13.5 hour flight. When we asked if we could sit next to each other the woman told us it didn't matter we'd just have to ask people to swap with us or we would have to pay a minimum of $150 per person to change seats to be together. We went to complain and got sent to the priority check in desk. When we explained the situation, the person behind this desk said aggressively that the seats must all be sold out except the extra leg room seats. When I said the other person hadn't said these seats were extra leg room, just that we had to pay to sit together, she told me I must have heard her wrong or misunderstood her. The priority desk person then threw our passports and boarding passes on the counter and said aggressively ""you're all set"", when I asked ""what do you mean"" she rose her voice and said ""I put you guys together!"" and gave a shooing motion towards us with her hand. No apologies, no explanations. We the continued to the American Airlines security area, put our things in boxes and queued up to go through. A security person, again aggressively shouted at people saying ""you have to stay with your boxes"", so my boyfriend and I stayed in the queue to go through next to our boxes about a foot away. The same person then came very close to my face and said ""Miss is that your box?"" To which I responded ""yes"". He then said condescendingly ""who's pushing your box down the line?"" I didn't understand the question because in every other airport you put your box in the row and staff make sure it goes through the machine for you. So I looked at him confused at which point he aggressively pointed at the box and me and shouted ""who's pushing your box down the line?"" At which point I felt really intimidated and said ""I am?"" Then he said ""exactly. Then get over there."" I felt humiliated. So I got on the queue and walked in to the body scanner when called, stood on the yellow feet on the floor then the next security person again with horrible attitude said ""did you got through pre-security?"" I looked back saw there was nothing else behind me but the area I had just been shouted at in and said ""yes."" He then said sarcastically ""you look like you're wearing sandals"". Clearly I was. So I said ""yes"". He then said in an accusatory, rude voice ""you were supposed to take them off and put them through the x-ray scanner"" and gave me a shooing motion so I returned to the x-ray scanner, put my shoes in a box and got back in the queue. Just to clarify there were no signs or messages saying you needed to push your boxes or take off your sandals. The whole experience left me feeling awful.

American Airlines,1,H Walker,9th August 2017,"✅ Verified Review | New York JFK to Manchester. American Airlines is probably the worst airline I've ever flown with. After boarding we were kept waiting on the group for around 1h50 mins with very little explanation of why. I was sat at the rear of the aircraft and as there is no closed off area for staff they were pretty much just sat around chatting loudly (which is fine, but on most aircraft they have a closed off area and can do it without everyone having to listen). This aircraft had no seat back TVs so we had nothing to do. After take off we were given a very poor dinner, although there was a good selection of drinks. The experience so far was generally poor, but mildly acceptable considering it's a budget airline. However the last 2 hours of the flight were awful. Suddenly the smoke alarms began to sound and the staff very casually checked the aircraft for signs of danger (this was only looking in bathrooms and touching walls for signs of heat) for about 10 minutes. The alarms sounded for the remainder of the flight with no announcement or instructions to reassure passengers.

American Airlines,1,Jordan Barr,8th August 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Me and my family managed to grab a bargain with American Airlines on our most recent vacation from Glasgow to Orlando via Philadelphia. The price was more than 70% cheaper than any other airline operating the route, however if I knew the misery we would have to endure then I definitely wouldn't have flown with AA. The first problem arose at check in (GLA-PHL) where we were allocated new seats from the ones we had previously purchased resulting in my family being split up throughout the aircraft. We complained and was given new seats nearby each other but still not the ones we had paid £200 for previously, which American Airlines are still refusing to issue a refund. Next when we arrived at the gate we were informed that the flight was delayed but that it wouldn't be long and they were going to commence boarding - not long turned into sitting on the aircraft for almost 2 hours. The aircraft was old, in need of refurbishing, extremely cramped and didn't have personal inflight entertainment which American Airlines didn't tell us while booking. The aircraft did have an overhead screen which played one movie during the 7hrs 45min flight to Philadelphia, however me, and many other people sitting around us thought it was unsuitable for children to view. The staff were rude, never came across people with such bad manners, talked inappropriately about passengers onboard the aircraft (which we have complained about) and couldn't be bothered doing their job but instead stand at the back of the aircraft talking. The food was poor quality, even for airplane food, and was thrown down in front of us. The aircraft landed just over 2 hours late making it tight for our connection to Orlando. Once on the connecting flight we were told that our bags had missed the connection and would be sent on the next flight out, not the best news for the start of you're holiday. We had a mad dash to the flight, just making it by minutes to spare, and once we sat down were told that the flight was delayed due to technical problems resulting in another 2 hour delay. The staff were slightly friendlier on the connection to Orlando and we eventually landed about 5 hours late (thunderstorms near Orlando delayed us). We got off the aircraft rather quickly and proceeded to baggage information for American Airlines which told us that our bags wouldn't be arriving until the next afternoon, we were offered several thousand air miles as compensation which we rejected as we had already decided we will never touch American Airlines again. Our bags eventually arrived the next evening but an extremely poor service and lack of information from American Airlines.

My seat was changed while boarding to a row far away from my travel companion, no explanation or apology was provided. Gate staff at PHL are extremely rude, bordering on hostile, and are in need of serious customer service retraining. I do not appreciate PHL gate staff barking orders at passengers and not using the PA system prior to a 9 and a half hour long-haul flight. Upon boarding, a passenger opened a box of very smelly food and proceeded to eat it during push back - flight attendants did nothing to intervene. The quantity of diner food items was very stingy for such a long flight, and I would have been starving if I did not bring my own food.

American Airlines,1,P Dawson,3rd August 2017,"✅ Verified Review | It gets a 1 because zero wasn't an option. Our flight originated in Rapid City, SD connecting through Dallas/Ft. Worth, TX and then on to Newark, NJ. We checked four bags/items ($75 b/c the stroller was free) at the urging of the gate attendant at check-in because they advised the flight would be full and there would be little room in the overhead compartments. Upon arriving in Newark, we picked up two bags and the stroller but the other piece of luggage was nowhere to be found. The surly woman in the baggage claim area of American Airlines (AA) said that the bag was put on the wrong flight but that it would arrive later in the evening and be delivered within 24 hours. I then took the day off work ... but the bag never arrived. Several phone calls later, what we know is that they can't find our bag and that they really aren't particularly concerned about it. Almost every representative that we've spoken with in the baggage handling customer service department has been less helpful than the one before. They cannot locate the bag and they're ""not sure what else to tell us at this point"" (that's a quote). Meanwhile, I'm out an expensive Rimowa bag and several thousand dollars in clothing and other items. Some of them with sentimental value and which can never be replaced. Any effort at replacing our items will be a tedious and time consuming process and I'm sure will be laden with red tape and bureaucratic obstacles. And they won't even begin that process for 5 days. Even though they admit that they can't locate the bag and it's coming up on 48 hours here shortly. American Airlines is a joke, they lose your luggage and basically laugh at you when you seek assistance. Two days later and they have no idea where our checked bag is now? This has to be the worst and least helpful customer service. The poorly trained customer service reps at AA are flippant, unhelpful, and totally unsympathetic to one's plight. The fact that this airline carries the name ""American"" in the company's moniker is a disgrace.

However on this flight, I was forced to check my carry-on bag because the overhead storage areas were full. After boarding this aircraft I noticed many items in the overhead storage that the flight crew should have required to be placed under the seats; things like shopping bags and purses. When I arrived at DFW for my connection I noted an earlier flight to my final destination that would save me 3 hours stuck in the airport. I proceeded to that gate and attempted to go standby. I was told that I was not eligible for that flight because I must travel with my checked bag. That's right, the bag I was forced to check against my will.

I decided to treat myself to the Admirals Club at JFK which to me was one of the highlights of the journey. Great healthy snacks, fresh guacamole and well made cocktails. The aircraft cabin was standard with leather seats, ample space and well stocked personal Samsung tablets. Now, I believe First Class service should be special including the check-in, what happened to the First Class Check in? It's just ""Priority""! The food was quite tasty albeit the meals were different from what the web-site listed in the pre-order. Here's the issue: the FA's were nothing but robotic and functioning. Fake smiles with minimal service. One drink service, expedited food presentation and that was it! I had to get up to get a simple glass of water.

American Airlines,2,J Dawson,26th July 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Greenville to Las Vegas return via DFW. My biggest complaint is when I was dropped off by a tour company at Las Vegas (after a 14 days trip) for my return trip home 6+ hours before the flight boarded American refused to check my bags. They said their policy was not to accept baggage until four hours before a flight. Effectively I was being asked to sit in the main departure lobby for 3.5 hours to check luggage. This was unacceptable. After I complained to a self-check attendant she finally agreed to issue boarding passes and said we could gate check one piece of luggage each complimentary. I had been unable to check in electronically due to the tour and spotty internet access. We carried four pieces of luggage, one carry-on each and one piece each we intended to check, to Gate D which is a really long hike. We did this and were accommodated but had to sit with the luggage all evening and take it with us when we went to eat. None of this made sense. Why would American risk making a customer angry and forego $50 ($25 each checked bag x 2) in revenue by refusing to check bags on arrival and forcing gate check? We were tired, hungry, facing a red-eye flight and just wanted to be shed of the baggage. Now let's backtrack to our departure from Greenville-Spartanburg. The flight crew did not show up on time. The captain and first flight attendant showed up for the flight at 7:50 for an 8:05 flight. The other attendant/s and co-captain showed up at 8 sharp. Needless to say we left late. Our connection through DFW was not pleasant. When our flight landed we sat on the tarmac for over 30 minutes waiting for a gate. We were told we would taxi to three different gates before the plane actually moved to the original one. We barely made our connection with time for a restroom break. When we departed Las Vegas McCarran to return home the rest rooms at Gate D used by American were filthy. A janitorial staff member was present but did not appear to be doing much. Many urinals in the men's room were cordoned off and out of service.

American Airlines,10,S Harris,18th July 2017,✅ Verified Review | I was headed from Chicago to Dallas Fort Worth with an 80 year old friend to attend her grandson's wedding. Upon arrival I dropped my friend off at the curb of the airport while I parked my vehicle. An American Airline employee saw me and immediately assisted me. Even though he was not yet on duty he still jumped in and helped me from start to finish.

American Airlines,2,D Tanner,18th July 2017,✅ Verified Review | Eight flights in last ten days with American. All OK basic average. Then arrived in San Diego missing one very important bag. American staff at the baggage handling area were neither good or bad and they advised me the bag would arrive next morning at 10:30. American Airlines employ a contractor or perhaps it's two contractors to handle late baggage delivery. My experience of this is that information available on whereabouts of your bag/s is very hard to obtain. The information on the delivery contractor/s website is wrong and not updated. Call handling by American Airlines is utterly appalling and amateurish. Call handling agents do not have required information easily to hand and that indicates American Airlines have a garbage infrastructure. After several phone calls one AA call handler kindly let me know the name of the delivery contractor and I was able to finally find out where my bag was and coordinate delivery directly with the contractor. I am shocked and a bit angry to note just how useless AA have been in fixing this not uncommon problem.,,Business,Premium Economy,Aruba to San Diego via Miami,July 2017,3,3,2,3,2,1,no
American Airlines,1,J Gorman,17th July 2017,✅ Verified Review | Richmond to Kansas City. I feel I was forced to purchase premium seats ($185) because there was no available regular seats available to choose from to guarantee me a seat. I would have chosen any regular seat to try to keep my cost as low as possible. When I contacted the airline they informed me that I would have been assigned one of those premium seats for free if I would not have already paid for it. I'm sorry but I do not want to take a chance of getting bumped from a flight because I did not have an assigned seat.,,Business,Economy Class,Richmond to Kansas City,July 2017,2,3,1,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,6,S Dorrel,17th July 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Tallahassee to Vail via Dallas Ft Worth. We are the only ones in priority check in just to be ignored while employees are having a great time talking and laughing. Then the one employee checking coach class customers helped 2 other customers while we felt like fools for paying first class prices. All was well and the 1st class cabin was comparable to competitors. Food was a disgrace. Service was good. White wine was served warm with no apologies. On our return again ignored while standing in priority check in while watching coach class customers jump ahead. Again food was a disgrace. This time the stewardess did say the white wine was not yet cold. And gave us the option of warm or waiting a while for it to chill. While waiting to board in DFW we ask if there would be a meal served. Trying to decide if we needed to purchase and carry on something for lunch. To our surprise neither of the 2 AA employees knew and had no idea how to find out. I guess my biggest problem is that first class prices should be supported with first class service and food. Our expectations are based on Delta's 1st class service. Pre flight video wasted no time bragging about being the largest airline with 6700 planes. And yes that's impressive, But please note, I can only fly in one plane at a time and really expect that flight to compare to the airlines with less than 6700 planes.

American Airlines,1,J Christofferson,17th July 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Virginia Beach to Chicago via Charlotte. About 50-60% of the time there is an issue. Typically, a delay. My latest experience not only included a delay, a cancellation, and then a flight change to one full day later, it also included a 3 hour cluster-you-know-what of uncertainty as to where our baggage was. The ticket tracing system was completely usesless and when I attempted to speak to one of their robotic customer service reps, I was told that there was nothing that could be done and that my bags would be available the next day in Chicago. (We were trapped in Charlotte for the night). The issue is that at the time of flight change to make up for the cancellation, we were guaranteed by an AA rep that our baggage would be released upon arrival in Charollette. When trying to explain this to the baggage service rep, I was told I was wrong, and that nobody could go get the bag for over 5 hours. There are many more details surrounding the disrespectful way that the baggage claim rep handled the situation but my qualm is with the rip-off that is AA as an organization"".",,Business,Economy Class,Virginia Beach to Chicago via Charlotte,July 2017,3,5,,,2,1,no
American Airlines,4,R Sanyal,16th July 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Although I had an American Airlines economy class ticket I was able to select an aisle seat in premium economy which has a 3-3-3 seat layout. The cabin was packed for this flight from London to New York JFK. The plane departed on time but after landing at JFK could not find a gate for over 40 minutes making a mockery of arriving on time. We sat strapped listening to regular updates from the cockpit. The plane was clean; the toilet ran out of tissue paper and a flight attendant had to be told. Soon after takeoff a packet of salted pretzel was given out to the passengers but no drinks leaving my mouth totally dry. Dinner was served soon after with complimentary wine and beer. I chose a pasta dish. The small tray was overloaded with smallish portions from all the food groups - salad, bread, entree, dessert. A hot snack was provided before landing. A large selection of films on the personal IFE but the free headphone provided was so poor in quality that I did not watch or listen to anything as the sound was inaudible over the roar of the engines. Advice: bring your own headphones. The seat was not comfortable at all. The padding and cushioning was rather thin. Worse was the tapping you felt on your back whenever the passenger behind pressed buttons on her IFE to select items for viewing - so thin was the cushioning. Not to mention the lack of any lumbar support. Flight attendants were dutiful and appeared when needed. Overall, another unmemorable flight and totally unimpressed with premium economy.",Boeing 777-200,Business,Premium Economy,London to New York JFK,July 2017,1,3,2,2,3,3,yes

We were very excited to go to our vacation this morning, But all these flight delays make us upset. Our flight to Miami was delayed for 1hour then we wait for hour and half more and eventually it was just canceled. It was looking nobody care about people in American Airlines. Information desk was closed when hundred people needed solutions to rebook flight. We eventually were rerouted to Jamaica by way of Charlotte, and experienced more delays at the gate for that flight!

Not long before 5:25 pm, passengers were advised the flight was delayed until 8:00 pm. At 8pm the flight was cancelled. At this time I had been travelling 8 hours including waiting in the airport. The gate personnel advised the flight would be rescheduled to 7/11. I was travelling to a memorial service scheduled for 7/11. I was unable to make the memorial service.

Our flight got cancelled they didn't have another flight for us. So we had to wait another 24 hrs just to get on a flight. Finally got ready to board and the plane had engine issues. So we ended up sitting on the plane for 2 hrs waiting for a new gate to be towed to. We had to wait another hr for another plane. We get on the plane and had to wait another hour for catering and baggage. I had my 3 kids and come to find out they didn't offer any food at this time because it was too late - we had been at the airport since 7.30pm and we did not make it home until 2 am.

However the gate area was crowded as the flight from Phoenix to Maui was full so it was hard to hear boarding announcements. Gate agent was pleasant. This is a B757 which means it is old. There is no seat-back IFE just the large monitors placed throughout the cabin. Didn't watch the movie because the sound was not very good. I had my tablet with me so I just watched a couple of downloaded movies on the 6 hour flight. Flight attendants came through the cabin a couple of times with drinks and selling snacks. One of the attendants was cranky but the others were very pleasant. Seat was worn and could use an upgrade. The flight was generally comfortable, we left on time and arrived on time and our bags were out about 20 minutes after we landed. Overall a reasonably good flight.

Now things changes and you get regular boarding, they just put you ahead in group number 5, but customer service at the gate of JFK was so terrible that you literally have to fight to get on board with your group since all people lined up and in rush. Another thing they forcing people to check carry on. Old planes. On the way back from Vegas even worse.

American Airlines,1,Matthew King,9th July 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Augusta to Albuquerque via Charlotte. American Airlines flies most Eastern US Flights through a Charlotte Hub. Their timing in Charlotte does not account for the ""chain of comedy"" error that are built into domestic flights governed by the TSA. In a recent round trip from Augusta GA to Albuquerque NM; the return was routed from Albuquerque to Phoenix to Chicago to Charlotte to Augusta. The lay-over in CLT was scheduled as 56 minutes. The flight in Chicago did not board until 25 minutes after scheduled. The pilot taxied to a runway, waited 10 minutes and announced windspeed was too high to take off, waited another 15 minutes, then taxied to another runway where he announced the wind speed was fine, we were 5th in line for take off. Arrived in CLT and deboarded at 10:12 PM at terminal B16, connecting flight doors close at E24, 10:20 PM. Needless to say, missed flight. American Airline customer service unapologetically offered a hotel and a 9:30 AM flight the next day as only option. Problem - had appointment that I could not miss at 9;30 AM in Augusta. I pushed it - wanted a rental, AA agent got a bit nasty. No rentals available, took car service back (probably cheaper than a 1 way rental in the end). Still arguing with AA - they claim total liability is $90 - the land mile % of total trip that was unused. They blame wind, weather, airport flight controllers and ""me"". I have been an engineer and project manager for almost 20 years, part of the measurement of my job performance is my ability to meet schedule commitments.

American Airlines,1,E Tanden,3rd July 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Cleveland to Minneapolis via Chicago. I have never had such a disorganized, rude, and downright horrible customer service experience. Our first flight was delayed because of one single passenger's passport not going through. A flight full of about 60-70 people delayed 45 minutes for one individual - which should have been figured out by removing her from the flight, as there were many people (at least 25) whom had connecting flights they had to get to, including us. We had a connecting flight in Chicago that was leaving 30 minutes after we landed, prior to the delay time. We were instructed to call the delay hotline to find flights for our party of 8 from Chicago to Minneapolis, in case we did not make it in time to catch our connection. We arrived with about 10 minutes to spare because of a delay in the mechanics with said connecting flight. We got to the gate to assure we were going to make it and it turns out the hotline screwed up 3 of our seats and booked us for a flight leaving 5 hours later than our original take off time that we sprinted through O'Hare airport to make. While I understand screw ups, the attitudes of the ladies at the gate was absolutely unacceptable. Not once did we receive an apology, nor did they seem willing to help, even though we were originally very calm and cooperative. They acted as if it was our fault and even made a comment about my manners, while they continued to treat us poorly. They were well aware of the situation and knew our flight was arriving with little time to make it to the gate and knew the number of seats that were needed. It was in no way our fault, as we did as we were instructed each step of the way.

A hot towel to refresh was another pleasant perk. Pilots kept us in the loop on the flight's progress. It was a very early morning flight on the first day of the month - the July issue of the inflight magazine was in the pocket and the crossword puzzle was quite engaging.

American Airlines,2,Kanthi Rameswaram,30th June 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I work in TX and work in NV, so I fly frequently Dallas DFW to Las Vegas, once every 2 weeks, and always by American Airlines because of the convenience (non-stop flight). AA is a Dallas Fort Worth based company. I am now a member of AA and a platinum Mastercard holder. I flew this morning (flight 542) in a seat that I upgraded paying $64. For this sum of money, I got to sit in 5C, a seat with a malfunctioning belt that refused to lock, I also got boarding privilege of Group 5 and my 2 bags were not the last to come out but close to last. It is an absolute disgrace that AA charges us $64 for an upgrade, for what? Did I mention the gate changes, on Sunday. I checked my gate online, and, I learnt that it was C10. The next day I got a boarding pass that said C7; while seated close to C7 we were told that it would be C8. Well we flew out of C24, I am glad I was paying attention, knowing that with this team anything was possible. AA is a very poorly run organization by people who are beyond caring. I think there were 2 seats in row 5 that had belts malfunctioning, 5C and 5E. Both the airline and DFW airport need a complete overhaul.

Had to make own way back to the airport. It was hot temperatures, and no one would provide us with bottled water. It took me an hour to get a $12 dinner voucher as I felt the $12 I got given wasnt good enough since $5 for a bottle of water at LAX.

Finally we were allowed to fly again and the staff at the gate seemed to not know where to redirect everyone to. They simply didn't plan ahead in any sort of way. When I was able to get my ticket (because the layover plane I previously had a ticket for has left long before), I had to wait 2 more hours because the flight crew had not arrived. The plane was more and more delayed. Additionally, they gave no sort of accommodation to make up for the massive time gaps. They sat me and my father in the very back with no hope to move up due to their policy of overbooking. Hands down one of the worst airlines out there. They are unorganized and do not care in any way about the customer. They have no communication skills or ability to handle inconvenienced customers. Do not give them your money.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Columbia to Los Angeles via Dallas,June 2017,1,1,1,,1,1,no
American Airlines,3,E Lydon,28th June 2017,"✅ Verified Review | After a bad flight experience with American Airlines 3 years ago, I was pretty hesitant to fly with American again but it was the best option for my needs and I believe in second chances. I arrived in Washington DC at IAD 2 hours before my 7.20 am flight to find that it had been delayed to 10.30 am and my connecting flight in Dallas had subsequently been changed to accommodate for the delay. Even though I asked two employees, nobody could give a definitive answer as to why the flight was delayed 3 hours. I realize that these things happen and my connection had been altered so I wasn't too upset with the changes, but once it was time to board the now 10.30 am flight things started to de-escalate. They boarded some passengers and then stopped and made everyone get off the plane because, our pilot was missing! There was a major miscommunication about where the pilot was and the flight staff didn't have much information to tell us at first. We later found out that he was at least an hour away at another airport in DC. Knowing that I only had a 1 hour layover between my newly rebooked flights, I was panicking. We were finally allowed to re board our flight after many miscommunications about the pilots whereabouts and the flight attendants seemed to find the entire situation comical or maybe they were trying to lighten the mood for their unpleased passengers? The only saving grace in this story is the employee at the gate counter. Without her help I would have certainly missed my connection, but because of her tremendous efforts I was able to make my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Of course, the trip home wasn't quite as terrible, but again I only had one hour to catch my connection and the flight leaving Oklahoma City was 30 minutes late and again I made my connection by 5 minutes. The flights themselves weren't worse or better than average and there are some very helpful employees, but I'm going to steer clear from American Airlines from now on.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington DC to Oklahoma City,June 2017,3,2,,,2,1,no
American Airlines,1,S Davidson,28th June 2017,✅ Verified Review | Quite a disappointing flight with American Airlines. I was on a long haul flight lasting 9 hours flying from Dallas to Amsterdam. Even though I have a small frame I found that the seating was cramped. There was not much leg room. The inflight entertainment was not working - no sound. There was no lighting (ie for reading) when the cabin lights were turned off at night.

American Airlines,4,T Leisch,24th June 2017,"✅ Verified Review | London Heathrow to New York JFK. As we had missed our previous flight due to a delay, we had to be rebooked to a flight later that day which worked out fine. Having only frequently flown United to the US before, I was suprised by the friendly flight attendants. Inflight service and the IFE were fine. As the flights were on time. I appreciate that AA has refurbished thier Boeing 777 fleet and I really the ambient lightning and new IFE. However, cramping in another seat in every row (3-4-3 instead of 2-5-2) makes traveling really uncomfortable. As a 187 cm/88kg Person, the extremely narrow seats makes it always impossible to find a comfortable sitting position. Even our British Airways connecting service from HAM to LHR in an A320 had wider seats. Luckily, the flights from London to New York are not too long. I will avoid flying American the 777-fleet in the future which is a pity as I usually really like these aircraft type.",Boeing 777-200ER,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to New York JFK,June 2017,1,4,3,4,3,2,no

They told me that laptop is considered an additional bag and I have to shove it in my backpack to give the illusion that I am carrying 2 bags. On top of everything returning from Philadelphia I had a carry on bag full of glass souvenirs. They wanted me to check in the bag due to no overhead space. I had to empty my carry on to remove all the glass items for me to carry them on to the plane. Lord be hold, I walk on to the plane and there is plenty of room above.

American Airlines,2,Dean Bellville,21st June 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I was scheduled on an American Airlines flight last night from Phoenix to Omaha. We boarded the flight and then was told there was a mechanical. Not a problem. I’m a million miler and understand. As soon as the problem was fixed the pilots timed out. Once again I totally understand. I don’t want a fatigued pilot flying the plane and it is an FAA rule that the airline can’t ignore. The problems started after all this. They said they were getting new pilots and it could take a couple of hours so they wanted everyone to deplane. At this point I’m not thrilled but at least we are going to make it to Omaha and I should be able to at least get in a half a day’s work the next day. We wait for two hours and still no pilots. They make an announcement that the pilots are coming in on a flight in 15 minutes and will be at the gate directly across from us. That was great news but a total lie. A few minutes later I hear someone on a radio say the pilots had never acknowledged the tag. My understanding is pilots never respond to these requests so I’m not sure why they even try or get the passengers hopes up. So the plane lands and deplanes I see the pilots get off and walk away. The gate has still not told anyone. About a half hour later the gate agent announces the flight is officially cancelled. The airline knew there was a shortage of pilots and no one ever accepts a tag so why did they hold us all captive for four hours after they knew the flight would cancel anyway. I would have been fine if as soon as the pilots timed out they cancelled the flight knowing they didn’t have any pilots to cover it. Things like this are why people hate airlines. Not only did they make me miss a whole day of work, they wasted four hours of my day for no reason.",A319,Business,Economy Class,Phoenix to Omaha,June 2017,4,5,,,1,1,no

My outbound flight from London Heathrow to Charlotte was fine, as was the internal between Charlotte and LaGuardia. But as my return flight from New York to London Heathrow was overnight I went ahead and purchased extra legroom which included priority boarding. Except it didn't. Boarding was exactly the same and the extra legroom was minimal. I am 6 foot 3 inches tall and even with the extra space it was pretty close to my knees.

American Airlines,1,A Owen,17th June 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I would not recommend American Airlines to anyone. They had me stranded in Charlotte after lying to customers for hours about our delayed flight from Las Vegas to Charlotte. First it was weather related then an airline steward was ""missing"" but on her way which was the reason given for the prolonged delay, at that point it had been already 2+hrs. We finally boarded at 1am, sat there only for them to say the flight was now canceled with no valid reason. The Customer service agents were absolutely awful. Best part of this all is they tell us there are no flights to Charlotte until 10.45pm the following day which was also a lie, they would not offer hotel comp stating that it was weather related delay and they were not responsible for it. So we board a flight to NY, then to Boston get here only to be told that my luggage is in Charlotte and it arrived at 7am, somehow my luggage got here before I did.

Because of the delay, we missed our connection to Sacramento. They closed the door early just as we ran up to the gate. I complained to the American Airlines customer service representative. She told me it was my fault for the missed connection and that I should not have booked the flights so close together. I tried to explain that it was a prepackaged AA flight connection that my travel agent booked. She put us on the next flight 2.5 hours later. That flight was nearly full and we were not able to sit next to each other. Also, I had paid for premium seats that we were not able to sit. The customer service agent also refused to refund the extra I paid for the premium seats. To top things off, the new connection flight was 40 minutes late taking off and arriving in Sacramento.

After waiting for over thirty minutes after our flight was supposed to take off we found out that there was no crew for our flight. They then said that they were working on finding one. After two and a half hours they decided that our flight was then cancelled. We then had to wait to rebook and dealt with a very incompetent front desk lady. After it took her 45 minutes to rebook us we had to find a hotel, the airline didn't even offer to pay for it even though it was their fault our flight was cancelled. After a short night in a hotel we had to go back to the airport to catch our new flight. We had been told that we would all be sitting next to each other and that there wouldn't be any delays in our flights. We were mistaken. Once we landed in Phoenix we waited three hours before we even boarded our plane, this was after they did a last minute gate change. Even after we had to wait three hours for our flight, we had to sit on a hot plane for an hour and a half before it even took off. We had been told we would land in Chicago by 2 pm. We didn't arrive until 5.30pm. With myself being pregnant all of these changes, delays, and cancelations were very hard on my body.

American Airlines,3,Alex Holt,10th June 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Miami to Nashville. My husband and I were returning home from our wedding/ Honeymoon in St. Lucia on Flight AA4658 from Miami to Nashville and I was carrying my very expensive wedding dress on the plane. I had called ahead to make sure that it wouldn't be a problem to hang it up before we left and was told that the flight attendant would help us find a place for my dress. We had been on four flights and on all of our flights except the last the flight attendants were helpful and polite. Our last flight was an absolute nightmare and everyone with us is very displeased with how poorly we were treated. The flight attendant introduced herself and she was extremely rude and condescending. Entering the plane we encountered the FA and asked if there was a place we could hang my wedding dress? She in return asked where we were seating, so we told her seats 12A and 12C. She curtly told us that because we were not flying first class she could not help us and we would have to put the dress in one of the overhead compartments. I was appalled by how dismissive she was. We quietly took our seats but I absolutely refused to shove my expensive dress above with all the other luggage, so we held the dress in our laps. Another flight attendant from the back came to greet us and was very sweet. She asked about the dress and we told her what happened. I told her how upset I was and she told us she would take care of it. A few moments later we saw her call up to the other flight attendant and it look like they were in a very heated altercation. Eventually the other flight attendant placed the dress in a hanging closed, but from that point on the first FA was even more rude than she was when we first entered the plane. Anytime she would walk by us she would make condescending remarks. When we were exiting the plane and asked for the dress she yet again make uncalled for remarks. We reached out to American airlines to complain about her unacceptable way of treating people, but we were only given a very generic cookie cutter response.

They delayed the flight 10 times before they canceled and changed the gate once which was just after midnight. So I waited seven hours just for them to keep delaying and to cancel. Guess what the reason was? The flight attendant was missing. They put me on another flight that was to leave out at 9:20 the next morning. That following morning we had a gate change and two delays but not by too many minutes. We did arrive on schedule to L.A. but guess what? My bag was kept on the original flight that was cancelled so my bag arrived to L.A before I did. I waited about an hour waiting on my bag at baggage claim thinking that they had it on the flight that I arrived on. I finally went to the back looking around to get answers as to why it was taking my bag so long. I looked at some bags they had positioned at the desk and guess what? One of those bags was mine. I could have saved an hour of time. They are horrible communicators. Very disappointed in my travel experience.

American Airlines,2,M Callenas,3rd June 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Miami to New York JFK. My experience with the American Airlines flight AA1048 (1 June 2017) was by far the worst experience I have had with any airline. Flight AA1048 was delayed over 4 hours (scheduled departure time was supposedly 3:30pm from Miami and arriving at JFK at 6:30pm), which resulted to my boyfriend and I not making our connecting flight to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. We ended up departing Miami airport at 7:30pm and arriving at JFK at 10:10pm at terminal 8. Our flight back home was scheduled to depart at 10:45pm at terminal 4 with Etihad Airlines. The staff at American Airlines (both at Miami and the JFK airport) had no concept of urgency, sensitivity or care to its passengers. Gate changes were made without clear announcements (D4 to D23) and passengers were not informed in a timely manner about reasons for the flight delay. Sporadic announcements were made when it was clear that passengers were becoming even more restless and agitated as their patience was being stretched beyond their capacity. One bit of information that was announced was that the plane was ready to leave however, the cabin crew was waiting for one flight attendant who was running late. This was actually ridiculous considering the flight was already late for 3 hours and she was still late. I do acknowledge that the pilot informed us in a timely manner the reasons for the further and ongoing delay, which was nice. Furthermore, I do also acknowledge his amazing pilot skills steering us through the crazy turbulence and landing the plane in such a smooth and gentle way. AA staff at JFK were rude, abrupt and showed no courtesy. After the plane landed, my boyfriend and I tried to get off the flight as soon as possible and when we managed to get through to the gate front desk, I spoke to a lady explaining to her that my boyfriend and I had a flight in 45min but she just brushed us off and said that since we didn't book the connecting flight with AA, there's nothing they can do. I asked her if it was possible if she could call the other terminal to notify them that we were on the way and she just said, ""Nope we can't do that and there's no way and that we missed our flight considering the time involved with baggage claim"". We asked her how to get to terminal 4 and what was the fastest way and she just advised ""go up that way and follow the signs"" in her monotone. She provided no equitable solution, not even extended a small kind gesture to appease our frustration as it was clear she did not understand the concept of customer service.",Boeing 757-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to New York JFK,June 2017,3,2,2,,1,2,no
American Airlines,2,J Snell,2nd June 2017,"✅ Verified Review | New Orleans to Philadelphia. Let me first say that American has long been my carrier of choice which is evident via my over 300,000 miles logged in the past 5 years (splitting time with Delta and SouthWest too). However, recent changes will be the driving factor for my migration to a new primary carrier. I don't mind the ability to buy premium seating but it has now grown out of control. American now intentionally forces me in a seat that is not my preference just so they can sucker me into paying for my desired position. The additional requirements preventing carry on baggage for economy coach, again could be bearable but only if the carrier holds itself to a higher turnaround time (which it does not).

American Airlines,1,D Haman,2nd June 2017,✅ Verified Review | Memphis to Houston via Dallas. This review is about American Airlines customer service and about the experience I have had with requesting a refund. I made a reservation using a evoucher but I cancelled the reservation within 24 hrs. I requested a refund and I learned that I would have to wait up to 2 weeks to receive it by mail. Two weeks later I check the refund status on AA website and see that a letter has been mailed to me but I never received this letter. Ive called customer service inquiring about this 3 separate times and spent over 3 hours and waiting over 2 months and still not received my refund. So I have to say that American Airlines has the worst refund process. I dont know when I will receive my refund.,,Business,Economy Class,Memphis to Houston via Dallas,April 2017,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,2,B Simpson,2nd June 2017,"✅ Verified Review | American Airlines overbooked the flight from St George to Phoenix by 1 passenger. I checked in 35 minutes before the deadline of 30 minutes. I was at the gate before the 15 minute deadline to get my seat assignment since they overbooked. They said that the plane was full and since I was the last one to check in, that they could book me on the next flight which was 5 hours later. I said that if they knew that the flight was overbooked, why didn't they ask for volunteers, I had to go to work. They were very arrogant, and gave me a hard time, in fact I had to beg them to give me another ticket on the next flight. I sent a complaint into American Airlines and all they said was ""sorry, hope your next experience will be better"". No compensation, just excuses. I sent in verification of my arrival on time, but they just ignored it. This is the worst customer service I have had with an airline. In addition, the security told the gate people I was coming since I was handicapped, so they knew in advance but managed to board the plane early and since it was full I was out of luck. This is the most unprofessional airline.",,Business,Economy Class,"St George, UT to Phoenix, AZ",May 2017,4,4,,,1,4,no
American Airlines,2,Amanda Finch,2nd June 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Charleston to Indianapolis via Washington. The employees at the Ronald Regan Washington DC airport have no people skills. I missed my connection due to air traffic and was denied any type of voucher. The captain said it was weather related, but when we arrived there was barely any evidence of weather ever having occurred. This airport was the most unpleasant leg of my trip both going and returning. Employees were rude to me at every turn as if I'm supposed to know how these things operate. I was told to ""back up and get out of my face"" after running to a podium to try to connect with said missed flight when I was only verifying that the flight was indeed gone. I was told ""ma'am calm down"" when I came to the gate after being called and asked what I needed to do. I am very laid back and patient, so this was uncalled for. These people are disorganized and undertrained.

American Airlines,7,R Kessel,30th May 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Tokyo Narita to Chicago return. I had apprehensions but prices were lower than Asian carriers with significantly shorter travel time including domestic connection in Japan. Online check in for feeder flights with Japan Airlines not possible, but could change and select seat for longhaul both ways. Window on the way there, legroom rather tight as mentioned in other reviews, but bearable as seats are slim (I am 6'6"" or almost 2m). On the way back, had an aisle seat but a crew member was nice enough to let me sit on 18K/L which were both unoccupied. While most crew members just did the bare necessary, service was overall fine, and especially on the way back some of the crew were genuinely friendly and seemed to enjoy their work, especially the more senior crew members, contrary to what I expected from other reviews. Food was alright (except for horrible, cold, way too salty mid-flight sandwiches) somewhat better out of NRT, soft drinks, wine, and several beers free. Three drink rounds per meal were plenty. Entertainment system responsive and with good choice, all flights on time.

American Airlines,1,S Masters,28th May 2017,"✅ Verified Review | San Antonio to Cusco via Dallas / Lima. I experienced a total of 3 flight delays out of 6 flights on our recent vacation. The total delay time was 27 hours. When I arrived in Lima from Dallas I was told my connecting ticket did not exist - I was told my ticket, and the ticket of my wife, that we had paid for, did not exist. I was then directed by Latam airlines (connecting airlines) to an American Airlines office; sadly no one was working at this office at 4 pm. I was then directed to call a local number; no one answered the line. I then used my cell phone to make an hour long international call, costing me 100 dollars (I have the bill) for my flight to be rescheduled for 10 hours later. So, 2 nights later, with about 6 hours total sleep time, my wife and I arrived at our final destination. The trip took 36 hours instead of 12. Of course, this completely changed our plans, cost me money, and caused me to experience a health problem. When I described my travel difficulties to an American Airlines representative, I was told that there were no guidelines that would fulfill my request for a refund. I was told that these types of problems, including forgetting to schedule a connecting flight when the original flight is delayed, are within what is considered normal operating procedures. I was awarded a number of airline miles. I have never experienced this kind of service. I have never written an online review of an airline. And I will never fly this airline again. The photo shows a throng of delayed passengers in Dallas after the first of 3 delays (this one 10 hours) - the airline sent us all to the same two hotels. Because the shuttles only held 11 people, and ran every 45 minutes, it took some passengers 3 hours to get from the Dallas Airport to the Super 8!",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Antonio to Cusco via Dallas / Lima,May 2017,2,3,2,2,1,1,no

They literally looked at my bag and my girlfriends bag, and slapped a sticker saying ""there is no more cabin area for your luggage"". All the while, there was plenty of space for our two carry on and then some. If you going to own an airline and operate one, you should take in to account how much space and what can be brought on the plane, accordingly. Not when you are walking on to the plane. I didn't have any of my belongings with me and yes I am a female and yes I did not have proper items when needed.

American Airlines,1,D Verdin,23rd May 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Denver to Buffalo. I'm not one who is usually compelled to write a review but the service I experienced this weekend flying on American Airlines was so horrible that I had to. It all began when I believed I left my debit card at the ticketing counter when I paid to check my bag. After exiting security and returning to the check in area, I approached an attendant and kindly asked him if anyone had turned in a debit card as I had lost mine, the guy doesn't even look up from what he is doing and rudely yells ""did anyone turn in a debit card? No?"" Then looks at me and says ""retrace your steps, it's not my problem."" Finally I get past security and to my gate, we board the plane and begin to take off. A passenger gets sick before we even take off so we return to the gate, completely understandable. After waiting for 30 minutes for them to clean up, we are informed that they need to ""wax the plane down"" which took another 45 minutes. It was at this point that the pilot stated that he informed all AA crew we were delayed so we could get to our connecting flights in Charlotte. 45 minutes into the ""waxing"" we were informed we were returning to the gate yet again due to possible damage to the tail. I needed to get to Buffalo that night due to an important engagement early the next day so I decided to exit the plane and attempt to get on another flight that night. The flight attendant rudely stated overhead that anyone exiting the plane would not be welcome back on if they took off soon. My last straw was booking another flight and due to AA already rebooking my Charlotte flight for the next evening, they were refusing to put me on a flight that left that night so I had to repurchase another ticket with the ""possibility of a refund"" which was eventually denied. Everyone from the checkin counter to the flight attendants and gate staff were awful. I don't even think they know what being polite or a smile is. On top of it, my bags were lost and I received them the day I returned back to Denver. I paid for extra seating and another ticket and they still will not refund me. Never flying this airline again. It blows my mind they can still operate.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Buffalo,May 2017,2,1,,,1,1,no

Only negative was the headrest, which was not well padded. Large movie selection. Excellent preordered food, but very restricted wine selection. Liked especially the ice-cream Sundae. Pilot had been sucked in a huge traffic jam, so arrived about 40 minutes after the plane should have taken off. Additionally evening air traffic delay at JFK, so that the plane departed about 2 hours late. Made up some of this delay, but we arrived nevertheless 40 minutes late.

American Airlines,1,Samantha Howard,22nd May 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I was appalled by the last of service and poor treatment given to me by American Airlines today. I have an extra three hours to wait at the airport and write this review because I was bumped from my connecting flight without any notice or compensation. The first flight was delayed an hour and fifteen minutes due to mechanical issues. Apparaty a bird had crashed into the plane the night before. So rather than have the issue fixed before takeoff, they make an entire plane full of passengers wait on a hot, sticky plane for an hour. Because the plane departed late American Airlines rebooked all passengers with connecting flights. I was one of them, the problem is that my connecting flight was delayed so I made the flight with time to spare. The aircraft didn't even change, the same plane I took on the first flight was also the same plane I would have taken for the second flight. But did American Airlines care? No! They bumped me from the flight I was supposed to be on and gave my seat away. The flight was of course overbooked - as per usual for American Airlines. After being treated rudely by the gate manager I went to customer service to ask for a refund (I knew I wouldn't get it but hey, never hurts to ask) and was told the best he could offer was a $12 meal voucher. Wow. To contest this further I have to send them an email but I am sure I will never be compensated or given an apology.

We had issues on our way to Barcelona with British Airways and back with American. Both times we were greeted with customer service that was quite awful. There were a few friendly faces, but what affected me most was the check-in lady who literally yelled at me and the people in front of us in line and then a flight attendant who also yelled at me about food on the flight, because I had my headphones in and missed her when she first spoke. When I removed my earbud and said sorry, she then proceeded to refuse me service. I come from hospitality and I know it's a tough job...but I also know you stay positive no matter what.

After the horror ripped baggage and damaged articles experience the previous trip I regret giving American Airlines another chance. After 2-3 months of explaining and convincing I finally was offered some compensation. The only reason I decided to take America again because of the $100 gift card they offered. Last week, I relocated completely from NY to TX. I literally moved my entire house from one coast to the other, and without any consideration to that AA charged me $100 for 3 pounds extra. Yes you heard it right, $100 for 3 pounds! The guy at the counter apparently had no power to let ""3 pounds"" in a check in bag go or make any exceptions and I contact customer care to take care of this later on, but all I get is a couple of copy-pasted auto replies from customer service and then they disappear completely. Maybe AA uses the strategy of ""let the customer lose patience waiting for our reply"". That way the case dies a natural death!

American Airlines,1,Robert Fanning,20th May 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Chicago to Boston. Short-changed on a paid upgrade. This was a late evening flight that got delayed by half an hour (and for the first time on American I heard the pilot actually acknowledge and apologize). Security at O'Hare was a bit of a zoo and most food outlets were shutting down as I got through. Since I have status and the cost would be $80 I paid for two 500 mile upgrade vouchers in the hope of getting bumped. My seat was already in main cabin extra with reasonable legroom, and I fly this route at least monthly but given the late hour and my hunger I thought I would enjoy an upgrade. The product was very disappointing and not worth $80. We were offered nuts which I can't eat due to an allergy. I was given a snack pack as an alternative. I was in seat 3E, legroom wasn't amazing. Seat comfort was ok but nothing special. I had a couple of drinks. Food and beverage value maybe $35 for a snack pack and a couple of whiskies (but they often comp your second if you buy two in economy so not that good). Slightly better seat but not much better than main cabin extra. No meal, no entertainment. Wifi is paid for either way and I never use it.

American Airlines,2,David Giampietro,19th May 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Palm Springs to Boston via Phoenix with American Airlines and American Eagle. This airline assumes no responsibility for the services that it sells to their customers. Three of us left Palm Springs (flight AA3076) on a beautiful day with hopes of connecting to our flight in Phoenix that was to bring us back to Boston (flight AA2341). Upon arrival to Phoenix our flight was running late, the flight attendant was aware of 2 groups of people with tight connections and all they did was to tell the plane to let those with tight connections to get off 1st and both groups were in the back of the airplane. We know how that worked out, we all got off last. They did not call the tower to say we were running late as reported to me by the person at the gate for Boston. There was only 30 minutes between reported landing time in Phoenix and lift off time to Boston if the 1st flight arrived on time. The gates were over 1/2 mile apart. I was the youngest in our group of three turning 65 this year and the oldest was 82. This information is all known by the airline upon booking a ticket on line. I ran to the gate for flight AA2341 and was told the doors were closed and are always closed 15 minutes before take off. I asked if she could call to see if the doors could be opened and she refused. The plane did not disconnect from gate for at least 6 more minutes. How is an 82 year old man suppose to walk 1/2 + miles to a connecting flight when seated in the back of the plane which takes 6-10 minutes to get out of allowing only 5-9 minutes of walking time (if it lands on time and it did not)? At the service desk rule 240 was not applied which entitles us to the first flight to Boston on any airline not just American which we were forced to do getting us home an entire day late. I emailed to customer relations who responded in a way that was unacceptable (basically saying sorry but there is nothing that can be done). I asked her to have a supervisor get back to me and not one response has been sent my way in over 2 weeks.

American Airlines,7,Pav Paul,12th May 2017,"✅ Verified Review | London to Colorado Springs via Dallas. After reading the reviews, before my flight earlier this month, I was concerned to say the least. Dreading my upcoming flight almost. But, after having flown Delta to Colorado Springs in December 2016. I am pleased to be able to say the conditions on AA main cabin were as good as, if not better in one area, as Delta. I can't actually see the justification for bad reviews in main cabin. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. The seat pitch was fine. I would go as far to say I feel like I had more leg room on AA than I did on Delta, but the seat width is noticeably less than other flights I've been on. Thankfully there was a seat between myself and the other passenger in my row, otherwise we would literally be squashed in, banging elbows and almost would be impossible to eat comfortably without encroaching on the space of the person next to you. I was contemplating paying extra for main cabin extra, but from what I saw, I'm glad I didn't. I would save your money as I couldn't see any significant difference in leg room, although it's supposed to provide an additional 6 inches. I wasn't uncomfortable in normal main cabin where I'd see paying extra worthwhile. Food is to be as expected when flying economy, it was acceptable but I've had better presented, tastier food on economy with other airlines. Drink choice was bare minimum acceptable. Not the best economy experience I've had, but acceptable. Cabin crew service was polite and friendly. Nothing really to comment on over and above what's expected. IFE was actually quite good. Lots of choice with current and classic movie choices. Overall. Not a bad experience.

Eventually they re-routed the flight to the next gate and everyone deplaned. I knew I would miss my next flight, so I was able to get a new ticket from another counter prior to departing. When I got to Dallas I went to the customer service counter and despite a line that extended down the airport corridor, there were only 2 attendants present. Surprised me since they knew how many people missed flights with the three aircraft that were late arrivals. Eventually they did get other attendants, but it took 1.5 hours to get to the counter.

I had two onward flights to catch, one connecting from LAX-JFK with American Airlines and one the following day with JetBlue. As the delay got pushed back further and further (more than 15hrs) with the first leg, it turned out I was missing both connections. I called up AA and they would offer no compensation for this delay. At this point I had paid a change of flight fee to JetBlue and had paid for a hotel in New York. In the end, after not backing down, they said they would issue me a $300 voucher for use on AA. However, they will only issue the voucher by post. 8 weeks went by, no voucher.

I waiting with another passenger for around 30 min before a rep showed up. When I was finally able to ask her what was going on with my flight she informed me that they had canceled the flight and that it would be leaving the following morning. When I asked her why she said they didn't have enough people to man the flight. I asked her to put me on another flight, but there were no more flights that day. Keep in mind this was around 6pm. When I asked for a refund she said she couldn't do that and looked away from me back at her screen. When I asked how to get a refund she told me in a very sarcastic voice to ""just call American."" At that point I unloaded on her and her horrible customer service and went to Delta and bought another ticket for $171.38. When I called AA to get a refund they told me it would take up to 10 days and that they couldn't tell me what amount would be refunded. I waited 11 days with no refund. When I called back in to AA they said no one had filled the refund. Once again I had to go through the process and wait. I finally go a notice that my refund of $115 was being ""processed"" but could take up to 5 days to complete. When I reached someone in customer service they seemed very unapologetic, like I was a nuisance. I tried to get someone to explain to me why my refund, which should have been $214 because of the seats I purchased, was so low they said, ""that is the amount our refund department issues."" No other explanation was given. I have since canceled my AAdvantage membership and made sure that anyone in my company that flies does not use American or any affiliate.

American Airlines,1,David MacDonneil,4th May 2017,✅ Verified Review | San Francisco to Springfield via Dallas. Do not fly American if you have a choice. I am currently stuck in the Dallas airport because I could not run across airport fast enough. My first flight was 34 minutes late due to its departure from Dallas. We land in Dallas I run ( yes as people made comments about me running). I get to the gate before listed departure but 7 minutes after flight is closed. The funniest part is took me 6 minutes to get from gate to gate but I was 7 minutes late and I couldn't run fast enough? WTF I don't know or have ever seen someone run so fast time went backwards-have you? They didn't hold flight 1 minute for me even though they knew I was there trying to get on flight but running late because of them American not me. Basically flights with connections are just bait to get your money when they don't care about you. Then the 2nd flight is with an American partner (American Eagle) who says there is nothing they can do for me as my reason for missing the flight is not there fault but can get me a discount hotel room for $100 a night and put me on the first flight in the morning.

I also told her I was pregnant and really needed to make the shuttle. I had no trouble on the way there and didn't purchase anything this trip so the bag size did not change.

My experiences from back then were not among the best to be honest. I even considered to take the train instead. Therefore I had mixed feelings concerning my connecting flight from JFK to Boston during Easter Holiday. I shouldn't have worried at all. The gate was close to the Admiral's Lounge at Terminal 8 and I was able to spot the aircraft while being seated in the so called ""bureau""-section. Boarding started well ahead of the actual departure time and there seemed to be a very light load on this short hop to Boston. I only noticed upon boarding that this aircraft had a three-cabin-configuration and is usually used for transcontinental flights. As a frequent flyer I was assigned a seat in the C-class section. I was able to stretch out and use the interactive map. Doors were closed 15 minutes before departure and there were no delays on the tarmac and runway either. The friendly crew even managed to serve all passengers a softdrink and a cookie. Take notice: This was a 42-minutes-flight only. Arrival into Boston was 20 minutes before schedule and bags were out on the belt 10 minutes later.

Using the excuse about everyone's safety is laughable. They don't communicate to customers how long the delay will be like other airlines.

I found the cabin crew most unfriendly and totally disinterested in any passengers. Both flights were similar in duration ie. just under 10 hours. Cabin crew appeared to want to get the meal out of the way as soon as it was safe to serve. About one and a half hours into both overnight flights all meals were served and cleared. Cabin crew disappeared for the next 6 hours to resurface one and a half hours before landing to serve a snack. There was no cabin crew interaction with fare paying passengers for the majority of both flights. There was no provision of water to keep passengers hydrated for an exceptionally long flight. There were no young staff as part of the cabin crew. I have been told the more mature cabin crew are very obsessive over staffing the long haul routes. What a shame. Pity they lack customer service. Also, I was witness to a male cabin crew member telling a young mother holding a baby to sit down in a not so very nice tone of voice, until they were finished working.

American Airlines,8,B Wijesinghe,22nd April 2017,"✅ Verified Review | DCA-ORD-DOH-CMB-DOH-PHL-DCA Route. This was an AAdvantage OneWorld international roundtrip award, using American Airlines (AA), Qatar Airways (QR) and SriLankan Airlines (UL). All sectors were above average, and reasonably close to being ""on time"". They connected well, and baggage was transferred with no issues. Check-in at DCA, reconfirm at ORD and check-in at CMB were very good, with CMB being the best, as UL has a separate ""Silk Route"" counter and entrance for business class. Meal service was good on all, and the seats comfortable based on flight length, with the A359, A333 and E75 being the best. Flight attendants were good on all sectors, and were outstanding on QR flights. My BA Executive Club Gold/OneWorld Emerald card gained me access to AA Admiral's Club lounges in DCA and PHL.

Seats were reasonably comfortable, plane was clean and entertainment system had decent options. Took off at 10:30p (on time) and shortly after, flight attendants came through with drinks and a dinner service. Wine choice was decent and food was as well. Portions were small but for us just right to sit for 12 hours. FA's came through and picked up quickly and cabin lights dimmed for sleep. Flight attendants were very nice, efficient. Had a nice talk with one of them- this route takes more than 20 years seniority with AA but FA's were engaged and helpful. I asked for a head set for the entertainment system and one of them remembered and found one for me. All in all a good experience.

After everyone boarded and a few minutes afterwards, the captain announced there was engine problem and there would be a delay. Immediately I began to panic because I couldn't get the air vent to work. I informed the stewardess several times with tears steaming down my face, that I was freaking out and I needed air, and she informs me that once the plane took off, I would get more air. After waiting 30 long minutes on the runway, the plane finally took off and a guy sitting next row saw the panic and my knees shaking, he attempted to help with the air vent. There were four empty seats in front of me and not once did either cabin staff attempt to accommodate nor ask me why I was crying. Meantime my husband tried to fix the air vent but to no avail.

My family and I were taking our first family vacation in 20 years, as there are 9 of us, we booked our flight almost a year in advance to ensure that we would sit together, especially since my 2 year old niece would be coming as well and it was her first time flying. About a month before our trip we were told that all of our seats were changed and none of us could sit together. They had my 2 year old niece sitting in a seat alone. When we called to sort this out we encountered nothing but pure rudeness and constant transfers. After 4 hours (no exaggeration) on the phone trying to just change one seat so my niece wasn't alone, we were told there was nothing we could do and would have to try and change our seat at the airport, mere hours before we were supposed to take off and that nothing was guaranteed. We started out in Philly, flying to Orlando. The entire staff was rude, yelling at passengers as we tried to board the plane telling us that we had to check our carry on bags because there was no space left on the plane. After all the chaos, she was able to sit with her daughter and a nice man switched seats with her husband, so my niece was able to fly with both her parents by her side. Once we got on board there was plenty of room for additional carry ons, some overhead compartments were completely empty. We had a wonderful vacation and then on the flight back home we had the same issue. My entire family was spread throughout the plane and once again my 2 year old niece was booked in a seat alone. The staff on the flight coming home were much nicer and much more accommodating but it wasn't confirmed that my sister would be able to sit with her daughter until literally 1 minute before we boarded. As we were attempting to switch her seats we met several other families that had the same issues as we did. Countless children 7 and younger were seated alone and apart from their families.

Meanwhile, no food or even water has been offered while sitting here, which at this point and after a 5 hour flight, I would categorize as basic human goodness, let alone customer service.

American Airlines,1,C George,31st March 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I had no choice but to fly American Airlines due to the fact that an organization purchased the ticket for me (otherwise I would have picked any other airline except AA based on prior experiences). Unbelievably rude and dismissive in-flight service: I got up to ask the flight attendant for water in the bathroom/mid-section area. She was bent down and shoveling trays inside a cabinet. There were other passengers standing around her - clearly waiting for her to finish. But not only did she not pay attention to any of us, but when I gently asked if I could just grab the water and pour it myself, she glared and almost shouted at me - ""Can you not see that I'm in the middle of something!"" Then she thrust the bottle into my hands and as I turned away she said, ""Hold up! Where do you think you are going with that bottle of water!"" Another passenger around us took some empty cups and passed to me as we poured each other water and did not want to get in the way of this flight attendant's anger. When it came time for sandwich/food service. This same flight attendant pulled the cart asking people ""sandwich? sandwich?"" When she came to my row (which is not far from the front), I used my most friendly voice to ask her could she tell me what kind of sandwich are were. To my surprise, she gave out a loud and exasperated sigh - turned to ask her colleague about the type of sandwich, turned to me and said, ""it's turkey, turkey!"" Then without asking me whether I wanted it or not - she threw the sandwich down on my tray table. I felt so insulted by this flight attendant.

Flight attendants were extremely unhelpful. Plane was 25 minutes late despite having been parked at the gate for 2+ hours prior to take off. Gate agent was late getting to the gate to let crew onto aircraft and get us boarded. 25 minutes late getting into DFW. No connecting flight information was given by flight crew. Our connecting flight boarding passes had the wrong gate listed. When we landed I asked an agent at the gate to call the gate of our connecting flight to let them know, she said she couldn't do that but told us we should hurry. My 75 year old father and I ran through the airport only to have the gate agent at our connecting flight litterally close the door in our face and tell us there was nothing she could do to get us on the plane. The next flight was 2 hours later, which made us late for our meeting.

American Airlines,10,B Klein,30th March 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I was on flight to Charlotte from Munich via London. My plane from Munich was already delayed due to weather, so my 1.5hr layover in London for a USA flight was cut down to 40 minutes (in which I needed to change Terminals, go thru security and get to the other side of the airport). My American Airlines flight which left on February 22 at 1:30 pm was already closing, so I had started to run. I finally arrived, out of breath and about to collapse. The gate lady let me quickly run across the hall to purchase a bottle of water before I dehydrate. Finally on the plane. I sat a good 10 minutes in stillness, trying to catch my breath. I wanted to get comfortable and ""set up"" for a transatlantic flight when I noticed that I had lost my cellphone! I ran up to the stewardess and explained my situation. She calmed me well, but explained that I couldnt leave the plane. Another staff came up and inquired what was wrong. I told them I needed to leave and get my phone, thinking I hopefully left it by the gate or the small store across the hall. He walked out and some minutes later returned with my phone. My vacation was saved and I couldn't thank him enough. Both of those flight attendants had done such an awesome job at calming and fixing the whole ordeal. I flew again with AA on my return trip on March 6th to London and they were my attendants again! It was wonderdul to see them again.

American Airlines,1,Rich Claar,30th March 2017,"✅ Verified Review | American Airlines flight from Milwaukee to Chicago was showing as delayed by 35 minutes upon our arrival to airport. No problem as we had 1 x 2.5 hour layover for a connecting flight. However, time went on and the departure time kept getting extended for no reason given. We were instructed that the flight would still occur. When the flight showed a departure time of 9.51 (almost 2 hours past its original time - and keep in mind the flight is only a 45 minute flight from Milwaukee to Chicago), I went up to find out what was going on. Fortunately a pilot was there and told me that the 1st plane had mechanical issues and then another was sent for and it returned for mechanical issues and that they were looking for another plane. They were talking about getting a bus to send passengers to Chicago. Unfortunately, that would no longer be an option as it would take at least 2 hours to drive, park and get to gate - which means we would be missing our connecting flight. Why didn't someone make that decision sooner - or at least let us know as I could have driven to Chicago or got my own transportation. No communication. When a gate agent finally arrived, she said she could change our flight to get us to our destination, but it was not leaving until 4 pm (we had been at the airport since 6.20 am). So now we had to wait until 4 pm to leave and it was 10 am at that point. We were later given some food vouchers by a ticketing agent as the gate agent seemed to think that this was normal for AA and she agreed with us but there was nothing she could do. When we tried to use the vouchers - which states only good for food and beverages - at Nonna's restaurant, they refused to honor part of it as we had two drinks with our food and they stated that it did not include alcoholic beverages - which it does not state on the voucher anywhere. Again, more issues. We finally arrived at our destination over 7 hours late (which is big in a short 4 day vacation). The experience was terrible all around. So much so that we are looking at cancelling our Citi Advantage card and never flying AA again.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Chicago via Charlotte,March 2017,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,E Klimen,30th March 2017,"✅ Verified Review | My university booked 45 people on a flight from New York JFK to Santiago, Chile, with a layover in Miami. When we arrived at the airport (luckily with plenty of time), the kiosks could not process our confirmation code and many of us got error codes. Customer service slowly and painfully manually checked us all in and took our luggage. When returning from Santiago, we arrived at the airport ready to encounter the same issue. This time, the kiosks once again did not work, but the customer assistance agent would not let us all enter the line to get manually checked in. Instead, they roped off the entrance to the EMPTY line and ""had to talk to the manager first."" We explained that there were 45 people under one reservation code and the kiosks would not check us in, but they were adamant about having each of us wait for the kiosk to give us an error code and then get in line for customer service. I explained that we would all miss our flight if all of us had to wait in line for a kiosk, error code, and then for customer assistance. After ""talking to the manager,"" the agent offered to check half of us in, not that this makes any sense because all 45 of us had a ticket number to board the same plane. Finally, after ignoring the agent and just entering the line, our bus driver came to argue with them as well to let the rest of the group through. The agents denied that 45 could possibly be under one confirmation code and have a group reservation (Why else would 45 people show up at the airport together?). Eventually, they let everyone through, did not find more agents to assist the line, and clearly had not communication amongst themselves. Luckily, everyone got through security in time for the flight, but I'm sure if some of us hadn't just ignored them all together, some would not have. The woman also printed my first boarding pass twice instead of printing my boarding pass for both legs of the trip, thank god the kiosk before security during my layover worked, or I would have missed my connecting flight since there were no attendees at the counter in Miami.",,Business,Economy Class,New York JFK to Santiago,March 2017,2,4,3,1,1,1,no

Once I rushed out of one American airline flight to get to my connecting flight was delayed by 3 hours mind you I'm trying to rush to not miss it. I arrive to the gate they say they are delayed because the staff is overworked and they are waiting on new staff, which to me is ridiculous and makes no sense. Once almost 4 hours passed they call us to board the plane, a rude lady was giving everyone attitude and was upset for whatever reason and did not want to answer questions. So now at this moment we are on the airplane waiting to depart and waiting on the runway for 30 mins - at this point we are delayed by 4.5 hours for a flight that only takes 30 Mins.

Last time I flew with American in January, the plane never showed up and I had to wait in the airport from my original destination for 7 hours.

The boarding started only 20 min before departure but the passenges were stuck in the jetway for 10 min before getting aboard. Boarding was more or less chaos. Only one of the cabin crew were greeting passenges and the rest of them were just talking to each others. The breakfast was served after take-off and it was quite small for a business class meal. The second meal was a pizza. Ice cream or cake were served between main courses. The seat was good as it's new generation seat for American Airlines business class on B777-300.

The business class and first class connection between Dallas Fort Worth and Orlando then Orlando to Los Angeles on the return was comfortable. All flights and connections were on time. In fact one departed early to avoid a storm in LAX. The long haul transpacific flight offered a lie flat bed but that had a hump just at the small of your back. If you angle it 170, it disappears. Managed quite a number of hours of sleep. Food service and choice was more than adequate and of course the highlight was the sundae for dessert. However for breakfast they ran out of the egg option and had to settle for fruit and granola on both routes. Service was friendly and efficient. Late night snacks are available on demand and was good. The Bose noise reduction earphones were really effective, but the disposable ear-pieces on the short haul flights were not worth using.

American Airlines,1,Shirley Westbrook,16th March 2017,"✅ Verified Review | St. Louis to Chicago. I’m completely devastated. My husband and I have been married for three years, but we never had a honeymoon. So we saved up our money to decide where we would go within the next five years. He had to have major surgery, so we scheduled for this year. He’s never flown before and was excited and anxious. We made a reservation with Carnival Cruise to coincide with our anniversary but before his surgery, because life is short. Everything was fine as we filled up our Expedition for the two hour drive to Lambert Airport. We found parking and got on the park shuttle. I knew a little bit from prior experience, but my husband was worried and nervous. The first thing out of place I noticed was when we were at the gate waiting to board. The captain and crew got on about ten minutes before we were called to board. There was a request for anyone with a carryon with wheels to check them at the desk due to a full plane. As we boarded I noticed the captain laughing and holding a conversation with two flight attendants already aboard. Then the problems started. It took a while because the flight attendants were trying to find space overhead for everyone’s carry-ons (we didn’t have any.) The captain taxied off, then stopped. He told us we had to wait awhile for the plane to be de-iced. (That took 50 minutes.) He taxied again and went around three times. Finally, he told us that his compass wasn’t aligned and he needed to have maintenance take a look at it. But, there was no gate available, so we would have to wait until one opened for him to dock. (That took another 30 minutes.) During this wait, one of the female flight attendants told us to call or go online to rebook if we had connecting flights out of Chicago. I called immediately and was told by a representative she could not rebook us while we were still on the plane. I explained that we needed to catch our connecting flight from Chicago at 8:30am and if we missed it we would miss our cruise. Absolutely no sympathy given. Finally we docked. After 30 more minutes of uncertainty, the captain told us the plane is being put out of service. I called the cruise line for help to get to our port in Miami, while my husband called American Airlines to see what can be done. We got off the plane and was told little to no info. We asked where our luggage would be and told it would be held until we had another flight. The rep found us another flight, but it would make it there after the cruise had already departed. Mind you, one flight had already boarded and ready to leave at 7:19am. Too bad we were stuck on the tarmac. The cruise line couldn’t find a plane for us because all flights were booked and full. We made several phone calls trying to salvage our delayed honeymoon to no avail. Finally, we accepted defeat and requested a refund and looked for our luggage. This turned into another time consuming ordeal. We drove back home dejected. It was a very quiet two hour drive. We had a million questions and no answers. I called the cruise line as soon as we got home to see if we could book another one. I found one sailing 3/16/17 after working with a remarkable woman. Unfortunately, there were no flights available.

After I arrived to Chicago my flight to Dayton was cancelled due to no crew. The person who helped me with rebooking told me that I have an option to buy another ticket.

He gave me a voucher for food which was not enough and had to pay extra money out of my pocket.

I found a great ticket price and thought the drive to Cincinatti was worth the hundred dollars I saved however, the experience is one I will never forget. The best I can say is you get what you pay for. Although the inflight service was excellent in the old planes and the flight attendants were warm and grand, the check-in counter people are subpar and definitely not worth the hassle of traveling with the company. I have chosen to just pay the extra dollars, plan ahead of time, and never fly with American Airlines again. The online response team gets back to you quickly with a response. However, the experience of the check-in counter people is amazing to me. They are slow. Which in my observation is not a ticket counter issue but a archaic technology issue. For sure you need to get to the airport 1.5 hours early because simply checking in takes 15-20 minutes per person. I didn't see anyone come to the front and get thru their process swiftly.

American Airlines,1,K Caws,13th March 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Flew American Airlines from Denver to Liberia via Miami. I had eight people on a flight for my wedding to Costa Rica through Miami. They boarded the plane 15 minutes early (of course we were delayed taking off for 45 minutes) so when we arrived at the designated boarding time the agent informs us our carry on bags will have to be checked. When I say that's fine but ask if anything can be done about the wedding dress she immediately becomes rude saying we should have been there on time. Apparently we should have known they were boarding early. She demands the boarding passes if we want to make the flight at all. As I am trying to get all 8 separated from the connecting flight boarding passes she threatens to keep me off the plane ""if I throw one more boarding pass at her"". I was sliding them off the stack of paper I was holding onto the counter. None touched her or even went to the edge. She comes around the counter to tag our bags telling me I would have had to check mine anyway. I responded that I've never had any problem with it as a carry on in 5 years with numerous airlines. She pointed to the expander zippers being opened as her rationale. I took the boarding passes from her and she said that she could keep me off the plane until I cooled down and that she was going to tell the pilot about me. I did not raise my voice, curse, or even argue at any point throughout this encounter. I said nothing and boarded the flight as I needed to get to my wedding. Once onboard there were at least 5 overhead compartments with room for the dress. Begging the flight attendants did absolutely nothing and they closed the half full compartments.

The thing looks great, lots of storage space, great in flight entertainment system and very decent food. Staff was pleasant. It all went a bit downhill when I tried to sleep. The seat is awkward and asymmetrical when flat. It's very hard and really tight in places. In my case, seat 2D, the left armrest goes down while the right is fixed meaning great shoulder space on your left and squuezed in on the right. There is a big pad on the right side of the seatbelt which gets in your way every time you turn over. Also the tray does not stow away which means you bang your knee every time you turn. When lying on your side one side is quite restricted with regards to bending your knee.

We had more leg room in our much shorter connecting flight from LA to Seattle with Alaska Airlines. Our flight from Auckland to LA was a pitiful excuse for an international flight.

American Airlines,2,T Radina,3rd March 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Houston to Puerto Vallarta via Dallas. This will be the last time I fly on any American Airlines flight. From the moment I was in line at Houston IAH to head to my destination, to my return to Houston, the people that represent AA lacked customer service skills. The officer reviewing passports at IAH was extremely rude and sarcastic to every person that went through her line. She talked down to paying passengers with no provocation from them. She was making it clear to passengers that she had been there since 2:30 am. Perhaps she needs to find another position more suited to her so that she does not take out her displeasure with her work schedule on paying and unsuspecting passengers. On my return flight, my bag did not arrive on the same plane as I had. It was delivered the next day. At home when I opened my suitcase, I noticed that I was missing a bag of clothes. I called AA lost/missing baggage department and yet again, the agent was rude and lacked customer skills.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Puerto Vallarta,February 2017,3,2,2,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,N McGhee,3rd March 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I purchased a flight from American Airlines from San José SJO to Washington with an 18 hour layover in Dallas, thinking that missing a day of work would be worth the money I saved in ticket prices. We were charged to recheck our luggage in Dallas before being allowed to board our flight to Houston, even though this policy is listed nowhere on the AA website or in any of the emails I received from them, not even in the fine print. We were basically extorted $65 with no alternative option other than to leave our professional equipment behind or lose our seats on the non-refundable flight. This was such a blatant scam, I am honestly appalled that something like this can even happen. Also, good luck ever getting ahold of a human being - we called customer service and they wouldn't even talk to us. We had to express all of our concerns over email. Neither of us or our families will ever fly with American again no matter how much money we will have to pay to any other airlines.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San José to Washington via Dallas,February 2017,3,4,,,4,1,no

Optional to them, not to us surrounded by a dozen TSA agents. Not greeted by an attendant during boarding. Sat about 45 minutes after landing while they figured out where to park. Then had to wait to board connecting flight for another attendant to show up. On the way back, had to wait in the plane as apparently no one told the ramp operator that we were there.

If the attendant would have just helped us we wouldn't have been forced to stay a night and get placed on stand by. To top it off she was rude as hell towards us.

The usual limited poor selection of food which fortunately we could avoid as managed to grab a quick bite in transit at ORD before boarding. Only redeeming features were the fact that the flight left and arrived early, the plane was not full (seems most American airlines fly the smallest planes possible with maximum capacity.

American Airlines,6,C Bailey,1st March 2017,"✅ Verified Review | With the exception of the pitiful food options which we were forced to eat after a disastrous transit through DFW, perhaps the best American Airlines flight I have taken flying from Dallas Fort Worth to Seattle. The plane was rammed as pretty much always but the saving grace was the seat back TV's with quality programming. As a family of 5 we don't have screens each, let alone travel with that many, as much as AA asserts that 90% of passengers do. Also benefitted from a very attentive and friendly FA who went out of her way to get me some milk, as opposed to cream, for my tea. Contrasting experience to 2 years ago on a flight with AA when I was literally scolded for asking that the cream not be put in to the hot water before a tea bag was put in. This was the 4th AA flight and 3 of those included FAs who were very much not part of the normal experience. Food options are seriously challenging for those unable to grab something before the flight. 4 of us opted for the $10 cheese platter which is about the best thing on offer. The other selected an overly loaded virtually inedible turkey and apple croissant sandwich.",A321,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Fort Worth to Seattle,February 2017,2,4,1,5,1,2,yes

I was going to a business conference - however the company hosting the conference canceled because of the Zika virus outbreak. I called American Airlines, they said I couldn't get a refund, but I could apply this money to a different trip. Fair enough. Forward six month later and apparently they have no record of my credit to put towards another flight. I then go and book my new flight and put a complaint in that I couldn't use my credit. I get a call back and the next day and they now said I could, and that the only way I could apply this partial credit would be to cancel my current flight, wait 14 days for the reimbursement, then call them back to schedule another flight with this credit applied. Seriously, why couldn't you just apply to the flight I already booked that day, instead of having me jump through hoops. No thanks, I travel enough to where I will just pick another airline - don't care about paying more, its the principle of the matter.

All the staff jumped on me giving me attitude, looked like they wanted me to be punished as if I had done a crime, snapping their finders and moving their heads like we imagine these people when angry. I was left alone and nobody told me what to do at this point leaving me speechless and vulnerable, this was only beginning of a nightmare. A manager of restaurant, not the airline, took care of me. Brought me to Customer service booth were they offered to rebook me next day. I then spent the night at the airport. As I explained to them my concern of beeing left alone for a full 24hr in an airport they said they would accomodate me: they gave me a voucher of a pitty hotel smelling cigarette, 12$us for next 24hrs.

They told us they were ""trying to find another plane"". At this point I'm concerned. Told us later they'd had ongoing trouble with first plane, but had only now decided to pull it for maintenance. While they searched for a plane I chatted with another customer who flies AA several times a month, she informed me it's actually rare when a flight they've sold tickets for is not missing either the plane or the flight crew, and that AA is always understaffed. They finally get us boarded, but we're severely delayed. We arrive at Denver, and find out that another delayed AA flight is parked at our gate and DEN doesn't have a spare gate to give to an airline that can't get any of its flights in and out on time. We end up sitting on the tarmac for 30-45 minutes waiting for the other plane to leave. End up getting off the plane an hour and a half late.

When I called to have my tickets cancelled, I was made aware I would be refunded nothing, despite booking and cancelling the flights almost 3 months in advance. Thus I spent over 300 dollars for literally nothing. This is outrageous and unethical, and American Airlines must advertise themselves more faithfully.

I was on my way to my honeymoon with my wife and we had previously reserved seats for them to be together. After realizing that these time changes were huge inconviences their customer service refused to allow for us to schedule our seats together and insisted we needed to pay a 100$ fee in order to get two seats together. Due to the change, the fact that there were already seats scheduled to be together on the previous flight, and the fact that we were taking their airline to Dublin, Ireland once we got back and they still did not budge proves that they do not care about their customers. For those who are not flying on their business credit card sure seem to be worthless in their corporate eyes. I could not be more disappointed with their customer service department or lack of its existence. This experience has definitely led me to start doing more research on airlines that I travel on.

American Airlines,1,Gordon Matthews,9th February 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I flew from London to Miami via British Airways which was a superb flight. Then I had a connection from Miami to Montevideo using American Airlines. The difference between these 2 experiences was staggering. When I finally cleared imigration in Miami (although I was in transit) which took over 2 hours I went to the business class lounge the staff were pleasant and the lounge not too bad but the food was minimal and not up to business class standard and I was given a voucher for 2 drinks. I use lounges all over the world and this is the first one I have ever used that expected you to pay for your drinks. I don't think American Airlines have any idea what business class passengers expect and I doubt if they care. We then went to the gate although they don't give you any information when you should go. When we arrived at the gate we had our boarding passes that had been issued in London (I was travelling with my brother) I went through fine but they stopped my brother and told him they had changed his seat. I asked the incompetent at the gate why? No apology in any form I was just told it was nothing to do with him and he couldn't do anything. I asked for the purser once on board and these 2 women turned up one was the purser and one was ground crew when we explained that we were not happy that this had happened they again gave no apology and said they it wasn't to do with them and what did they expect me to do throw people out of their seats? (ironic as this is just what they did to us). When we pointed out that there was something wrong with a system that allowed this to happen the purser got defensive and threatened to have us thrown off the aircraft. Just bullying us. All the time this was happening this was stood up in front of all the passengers a very unpleasant experience and dreadful customer service. The plane was tired, narrow seats that when you tried to lie down you felt that you were in a coffin, no built in entertainment centre, I didn't eat dinner but had breakfast which was appalling. All the crew were wearing different clothes so they had no attention to detail and no uniform in the true sense of the word.This is the worst airline I have ever flown.

American Airlines,2,Kara Hollenbeck,7th February 2017,"❎ Unverified | Philadelphia to San Francisco. My flight was delayed in Philadelphia for an hour, which caused me to missed my connecting flight in San Francisco to Sydney. After contacting American Airlines before touchdown in San Francisco, I was informed that they would put me up in a hotel and my flight would be changed to the next night. When I arrived at the terminal in San Francisco, I went to the American Airline desk and asked who I could talk to about my accommodation due to my missed flight. The first thing the women, who ended up being a supervisor, said to me was ""Well what time is your flight?"" I responded and told her that my flight to Sydney was supposed to depart at 11:25 pm -- her response, ""Well, it's only 10:50"". From there on I was in complete shock, what kind of response is that? I felt as though she was making assumptions about what I knew/ did not know before even asking me my name or flight number. I explained to her that I was already booked on another flight for the next night and for anyone who has flown internationally, as well as ever been to the San Francisco airport, knows it would be impossible for me to have made that flight (I was also already told prior to landing that they would not hold my flight to Sydney and there was nothing they could do except accommodate me). She then proceeded to tell me there was nothing she could do because the delay was due to the weather and not mechanics which sounds ridiculous to me. Not once did she ask me my name, my flight or anything. She was very inconsiderate and made me feel like this problem was my fault and it was not her's to deal with. She handed me a slip with an 800 number that I could call for a hotel. My main issues with the situation above were that from the start there were inconsistencies with their accommodations and what their employees are told. No one should have told me I would have been put up in a hotel if that was untrue. Second, was that this woman could not have cared less about a paying customer. American Airlines, you could not have put me up in a hotel for ~$100 when I paid over $1000 to fly with you?

American Airlines,1,D Leeson,2nd February 2017,"❎ Unverified | After a wonderful 9 days on St John USVI we left our villa and headed for the St. Thomas Airport. The car ferry from St. John to St. Thomas took forever because of local employees wanting to chat rather than work then we hit downtown traffic delays due to a cruise ship docking. We made it to the airport 1 hour 15 minutes prior to our flight departure. Upon arriving at the check in desk we were not allowed to print our boarding passes. There were 4 women working the desk and we were informed we were too late to check in. After explaining our delays beyond our control they still refused our check in. I was referred to a ""supervisor"". After explaining our situation once again, she completely ignored me. I asked repeatedly for her help in at least letting us try to make our flight and I was met with disrespect, dirty looks, angry gestures and nasty comments from all of them. I waited until arriving home to cool down before informing American Airlines of the horrible treatment and the attitude of these employees who clearly did not give a damn about me or anyone else. Their response to me from corporate was to send me a link to their ""check in policy"".

I flew out with Japan airlines from Boston to Bangkok with a stop in Tokyo, then back to Tokyo after vacation 3 weeks later. They offered a comfortable aircraft for a long haul, beautiful and attentive staff, and good food. I then took these American Airlines flights. A new Boeing 787 - it was like going on a cross country trip in a subcompact car. I'm 6' tall 215 lbs, I'm a larger man but hardly a giant. The seats were hard and narrow. I had an aisle seat and every time the crew moved past me they hit my (recently surgically repaired) shoulder. I promise I wasn't sticking it out in the aisle. There was no one in the middle seat so my left leg got a break but my right knee (with the seat reclined, which is essential) was jammed into the armrest in front of me. This aircraft with these seats should not be flying 11 hour routes. Not to mention the tired, older staff (maybe they didn't see my shoulder?). Lousy food and service. I'm done with American Airlines and their AA rewards scam. I have flown internationally only a few times but this experience definitely stood out.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to Boston via Chicago,January 2017,1,1,1,2,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,Donald Schon,30th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I am basically aghast at the treatment we received. Travel is difficult for me because of multiple back surgeries so I purchase first-class tickets for long flights. This itinerary was Phoenix to Medellin return via Miami. On the segment from Miami to Medellin there are only two rows of first-class seats. In order to squeeze in another coach row, American put in a divider between first class and coach immediately behind the second row of first class seats. Thus, both on the segment from Miami to Medellin and Medellin to Miami our 1st class purchased seats would not and could not recline. The stewardesses basically begged us to write a letter to American about this. On the tarmac in Miami we heard rumblings about not enough room for the luggage. When we arrived in Medellin, our first class priority tag luggage was not on the plane. Nor was the luggage for at least 20% of the plane. There had not been room in the luggage hold, which I assume means they took on cargo in preference to passengers' luggage who were flying on that plane. Since there is only one flight a day American would not get our luggage to Medellin until 9:30 PM the following night. They would not deliver our luggage to us at night. Thus, in order to catch our internal connection at 5:30 AM the following morning we had to drive approximately one hour each way. We arrived at 9:30 PM and were kept waiting in the hall until 10:30 PM as they would not give us our luggage until all the passengers on the flight just landed had disembarked and claim their luggage. I contacted American Airlines. They never formally accepted responsibility nor took me seriously. The compensation they offered, I assume to get us off their back, was significantly less than you would offer a traveler who was bumped. This is in spite of the fact that we have been very frequent users of American Airlines and had their credit card for over 30 years. This was an amazing experience at alienating loyal customers.

American Airlines,1,V Arroyo Ornelas,30th January 2017,"❎ Unverified | In carefully reviewing my options to return from Mexico City, I specifically chose a flight on American Airlines that would arrive in the evening at 7:07pm, even though the cost of the ticket was $30 more for two reasons: I didn't want to be in the airport at midnight and #2 I felt that this airline was a more reliable airline than the smaller less well-known airline options. On the day of my flight, January 26, 2016 I received a couple of e-mails letting me know that my flight had been delayed, first by approximately an hour and then by 1 1/2 hours. I was advised, however, to arrive at the normal time because the airline was doing everything possible so that the flight would depart at the regularly scheduled time of 4:40pm. When I arrived at the airport, no one was able to find my reservation and I realized that my flight had been cancelled altogether. I had to find an alternate flight. I ended up on an alternate flight with a different airline, arriving in LAX at 11:30pm, exactly what I had attempted to avoid. I ended up paying the higher price without the convenience of decent flying times. Next time I will go for a cheaper, smaller airline. At least if it is postponed or cancelled, I won't be paying the higher price for a benefit that I never receive. I was surprised and disappointed at this unexpected occurrence. I don't have a boarding pass to show for the airline I am reviewing because obviously I ultimately flew on a different airline. I am basically rating the inconvenience that their last minute change had on my schedule, the cost and the number of hours wasted in the airport looking for a resolution to the problem.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mexico City to Los Angeles,January 2017,,,,,1,1,no

American Airlines,1,S Simpson,28th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I flew from London Heathrow to Chicago Illinois this January 2017. I was pregnant and very tired from the previous flight. My seat was right in the middle of middle row. I was experiencing very bad nausea and vomiting at that time so I asked one of flight attendant to change my seat to the side so I wouldn't have to bother the person sitting next to me to get up over and over again. There were 3 seats empty behind us. I asked her if I could sit there, it was closest to the bathroom too. She said no, even though those are empty seats, you're not allowed to sit there. So pretty much they'd rather leave those empty than give it to a pregnant woman. Nice job American. She told me once everyone was seated, she would find me a side seat closest to the bathroom. I said ok. So I waited and she came back and told me there are two seats available and were closest to the bathroom. I moved there and there was 1 person sitting at the other end. Luckily, he moved with his friend and I got 3 seats to myself. Being tired and fatigued, I pretty much slept throughout the whole flight. I missed the dinner. When I woke up, one of the flight attendant noticed that I was one of the passengers who hadn't eaten, however she did not care to ask if I wanted anything. I got a glass of water and went to sleep again. When I woke up, I went to the bathroom and when I came back I asked the flight attendant if I could have a food tray, she gave me a very rude look and left. She came back after 15 minutes with the tray. I will not recommend or fly with American Airlines again. Our captain made an announcement that the in-flight entertainment system was out so we had no entertainment while flying from London to Chicago which was a 9 hour and 35 minute flight.

A bottle of water was given out with the meal and that was the last we saw of the cabin staff until they brought round breakfast after about 7ish hours.

American Airlines,2,R Graham,23rd January 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Kahului to Cleveland via Dallas Ft Worth. Terrible experience, stay away! My family and I had our flight home from Maui cancelled due to mechanical error/crew rest. This was only communicated to us after we were at the airport and were given several updates of the flight status. The American Airlines manager falsely secured hotel rooms at a local hotel that had no availability. He issued taxi vouchers to the hotel and when the taxi company found out that he was sending people to the hotel that had no vacancies, they communicated this to rest of the stranded passengers trying to find lodging. The manager would not even come down to baggage claim to address the situation with everyone who was trying to find lodging for the night. I was finally able to find lodging at a nearby Marriott and only due to my platinum status were they able to find me a room. My family and I finally arrived at our hotel at 2am and were exhausted and stressed out to no end. I was able to work with my travel agent and have American Airlines get us on a United flight the next day which was amazing. The American Airlines plane that we flew on from Dallas to Honolulu was very antiquated and did not have screens or USBs compared to the state of the art plane that we flew on with United to Chicago. Upon my return I was instructed to contact American Airlines customer service for reimbursement for our hotel, taxi, meals etc. Some of the AA customer service were very helpful, but the last representative would not allow me to speak with a supervisor or have a supervisor contact me to discuss complete reimbursement for my hotel. She told me that I would have to accept AA's contracted rate for a hotel regardless of my situation and stated that they offered my family $200 vouchers to use on a future AA flight. I told her that vouchers do not compensate me for expenses incurred by a hotel that I was required to secure due to their flight cancellation. All I can say is the cancellation is one thing, how they handled the cancellation is another story and the reimbursement for insult and injury is truly another chapter. Suffice to say for a difference of $300 which is what it would have required to compensate me completely, they have not only lost 4 customers, they have potentially lost many more after I share my experience.

My first flight from Seattle to Dallas landed well enough, but at the terminal we were met with mechanical difficulties getting the walkway gate to connect. The passengers were stuck in the cabin for 30+ minutes and a large number of us missed our connecting flights. We were told to sort amongst ourselves about who had flights coming up sooner than others. Chaos broke out and, meanwhile, a flight attendant nearby was making a personal call to her bank and was of no help in a time of need and couldn't be bothered to be flagged down. My next flight was delayed for weather issues (which I know we can't control-gave an obvious pass here), but was then delayed for yet another mechanical problem (twice in one day AA-really?). Again, I was confined to the cabin for another 60+ minutes total.

I was on vacation and found out I needed to head home to Canada ASAP just two days before intended departure (mind you, this was New Year's Eve). I looked all over the web looking for tickets with many different airlines and agencies and found nothing but economy tickets at prices typical of first class. American Airlines also were full of ridiculously overpriced last minute seats, that is except for one route through PHL and BOS which were almost fully booked and therefore was a dirt cheap ticket even compared to normal season tickets. I jumped on the opportunity and booked my tickets via PayPal, which made everything much faster and simpler. Upon getting to the airport I realized I needed to buy a tag for my duffle bag in order to get it checked... not the most enticing thing but it was a fast process through the machine and was taken care of within a matter of seconds. Upon boarding, I was not expecting much, granted, this flight was American Eagle and they are not exactly renowned for premium service. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of comfort the seat had, and the flight attendants were in a good mood as well. Complimentary service on the flights were the same, a bag of pretzels and drinks, but who needs more than that on a flight that's 1.5 hrs long? I might also add that having my connecting gate exactly next to my arriving gate in PHL was a very rare and warm surprise. Gate attendants were friendly and cheerful, and seemed to be level with what they were doing. In summary, American is by no means a high-class airline to me, but I guess I was lucky in having been under the care of some really great people and it was well worth the low cost of the ticket.

I do understand when it comes to weather issues; in fact, I am grateful that they weren't hesitant to make customer safety first. But the first 24 hour delay of my itinerary was purely the airline's lack of thorough preparation beforehand. Everyone had already boarded on the plane, and halfway into the runway, the plane decided to turn back and redo a checkup. From which they decided to cancel the flight for the night and try again 23 hours later. How was it that they detected the problem only right before we were about to set off?

Fare was on offer so I flew American Business class to the US and British Airways First Class back to the UK. Checking in - Heathrow airport I arrived at 05.30, the check in desks did not open until 06.00 for an 08.40 flight. I was aware of the desk opening times so waiting was not a problem. There was a dedicated check in desk for business passengers and when I arrived there was only one other couple in front of me. Check in quick and efficient. No problems encountered. As I was flying business class I was informed that I could use the fast track security lane and make use of the American Airlines lounge. Boarding as with all major airlines boarding was the usual, Family's with children, Passengers that require help / more time followed by business class. On boarding I was direct to my seat and once seated asked if I would like a drink, went for Champagne (very nice too). Flight attendants very attentive, refilling my glass when it became empty. Inflight entertainment, for business class passengers on the 767 you are given a Samsung tablet and Bose headphones. Great choice of films & TV on the tablet only minor niggle is that the tablet is taken back about an hour before landing so a bit annoying if you are halfway through a decent film, also I am not sure how passengers who do not use tablets would of managed. Seat - I found the seat comfortable enough, plenty of leg room. As this was a morning flight I did not feel the need to make use of the lie flat feature so I cannot comment. The seat is controlled via a touch panel and it seems a bit sensitive as while resting my arm on the side the seat started to change position, I did this a couple of times until I placed something over the panel to prevent me from altering my seat layout accidently.

The check in was an unnecessarily stressful and upsetting experience caused by the unprofessionalism and aggression of American Airlines ground staff. After 30 minutes waiting in line the ground crew member informed those of us waiting there that the five desk staff were finishing their shift and we had to leave the line. Despite protests from my fellow passengers the woman informed us the staff would “up and leave” when their shift was finished. I am sympathetic that their shift was over but surely it would have been more effective to allow those of us waiting to check in or be served by other desk staff. I have never seen staff upping and leaving when there is a long line of people waiting without making sure they were to be attended to. I was then instructed to join the general enquiry line. In this line were people who had missed connections, missed flights, rebooking flights, unable to check in manually, oversized baggage, etc. The staff appeared to be directing people to lines in order to be rid of them and did not allow questions to be finished nor addressing passengers’ issues. Just a simple “go stand in that line”. The complaints from my fellow passengers echoed my own disbelief that at one point less than five desk staff were there to serve the long line of people and there was no coordination of passengers who had little time until boarding. I tried in vain to ask if another check-in option was available - highlighting my fear I would miss my connecting flight to London if I missed the domestic flight - but was continually dismissed. After two hours of waiting I was finally able to check in my luggage and thanks to the security staff allowing me to fast track through security I made the flight. It should not take 2.5 hours to check in one small bag!",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MIA to LHR via BOS,January 2017,1,4,1,,1,1,no

Tried to recharge me for my checked bag even tho they cancelled my flight and left me stranded in Washington Reagan airport at night! So I had to get a hotel for 300 dollars for one night because that's what was available on such short notice and have received nothing from the airport for all this headache and I have missed work.

American Airlines,1,G Ince,10th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I've often heard that American Airlines is bad from reading reviews, but after my most recent trip from San Francisco to Tokyo through Los Angeles and back, I can confidently say that I will not book a flight with AA again, ever. My trip to and fro were full of issues. I chose a morning flight at 7am since the ticket was cheaper, and and got to SFO at 5am, while thinking that I was giving myself ample time before departure. I was badly mistaken. When I got there, I saw a long line of more than 40 people queuing. The American Airlines check-in staff were rude and unsympathetically telling people in the queue who have missed their 6am flight that there's nothing they can't do about it, although the problems were due to their slow service. When checking in using the self check-in kiosk, I had problems scanning my passport, the kiosk asked me to verify my travel documents despite my having an Indonesian passport and traveling to Indonesia, and it ran out of paper to print my luggage tags. Many of the check-in kiosks were unresponsive and no one was there to fix it. IFE was the only decent thing they had, their screens are surprisingly capacitive, which allows much better interaction with your fingers. Inflight cabin attendants were impolite. My return flight wasn't a better experience. Upon arriving at LAX after a 7-hour and 9-hour flight, I was told that my LAX to SFO flight was canceled and of course there's nothing American Airlines can do about it besides rebooking my flight to the next day (which they can't even do automatically), and I didn't like that since I have to get back to work the next day. I had to drive back from LA to SF after my 20 hour trip, while jet-lagged. Seriously, avoid American Airlines like the plague. Also, lesson learned, try to avoid flights that have domestic transits.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SFO to NRT via LAX,January 2017,1,1,1,2,1,1,no

I arrived at Toronto Pearson Airport last night on American Airlines. My luggage didn't arrive. I went to baggage services and they gave me a phone number to call the next day. I called this morning and the customer service agent told me that my luggage is still in Miami. They are not sure when it will get here. I have my medication in that luggage and now I have to go out of my way to purchase more. Amercian Airlines doesn't even provide any compensation for these sort of mistakes.

American Airlines,10,Ranjan Ray,8th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review | My wife and I went to College Station from Richmond on Dec 12, 2016 via American Airlines. We were scheduled to return to Richmond from College Station via American Airlines on January 6, 2017. We purchased our tickets from Orbitz. When we went to the Amercian Airlines ticket counter on January 6 to get our boarding passes for return flight from College Station on Amerian Airline Flight 2803 leaving at 10:35 AM, the American Airline Agent told us that our return tickets were cancelled by Orbitz perhaps by error and hence she would be unable to give us boarding passes. It was a real surprise to us! The plane was about to leave in less than an hour. I frantically called Orbitz and they expressed apology and tried to fix the problem. The first agent at Orbitz could not solve the problem and then passed the call to his supervisors and after being on the phone for more than two hours, Orbitz finally was able to reinstated our tickets in American Airline System. By the time our scheduled flight left the airport and our connecting flight from Dallas to Richmond got sold out. Orbitz suggested that we buy two new one way tickets for later flight and they would reimburse us. There was no guarantee that we will ever get reimbursed based on verbal commitment by Orbitz. So we got quite concerned. We went back to the AA agent and she understood our dilemma, she watched us talking to Orbitz for two hours to resolve the issue. She went back on her own and talked to her supervisor while I was on the phone with Orbitz. She came back to tell us that she would try to switch our reinstated tickets to a later flight from CLL to RIC via DFW. She worked on her computer for a while and finally managed to put us on a later flight. My wife and I were overwhelmed by the extraordinary help extended to us. We had to return back to Richmond on January 6. Without the agents help we would have been stranded and we are extremely grateful to her for her assistance.

American Airlines,1,Niccole Liriano,6th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Flying with American Airlines from Miami to La Guardia, New York has been the most frustrating and disappointing experience I have ever had traveling. The staff are rude and uneducated and they have many staff members who only speak one language (which makes it really difficult to communicate). I arrived late to my flight in Miami because I was on a previous flight that we missed due to bad weather. When I get to Miami I had about an hour to get everything done but with the lack of education and common sense from the staff members at American Airlines I was cut short on time. First off in my previous flight I was given a standby ticket for this flight because we were not going to make it to our original flight. When I get to Miami and tried explaining that to the staff member in bag check in she told me ""keep your mouth shut and give me your ticket"". She then tells me I'm too late to check in my bags so I decide not to go with bags. The women gave me back my stand by ticket instead of boarding pass which did not allow me to go to TSA. I then had to go back in the line to get a boarding pass. Finally got a boarding pass and TSA were excellent and let us go ahead of everyone so we could make the flight. When I get to the gate the ""manager"" told me I was not able to get on board because the doors were closed. It was 8.20 and the flight got delayed to 8.40. If I'm not mistaken you can board up to 10 minutes prior to flying. She refused to let us on and decided that her best customer service skill was to scream at us. An elderly disabled women caused a scene at the gate, and she was allowed to board. I refuse to take another flight with American Airlines.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,MIA to LGA,January 2017,1,1,,1,1,1,no
American Airlines,1,Paul Renshaw,6th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I bought my ticket via British Airways and 2 of the 5 sectors were with American Airlines. I had thought since I'd bought a full service ticket all the flights would be with full service airlines and not mixed with a budget airline. I am writing to BA to complain - even though the 3 sectors flying with BA were wonderful. My first flight with AA was Las Vegas to London via Chicago. I had no money on me and my cards were in my hand luggage as I didn't think they were needed. These were put in the hold anyway as there was no space in the lockers, but I did not know AA was a budget airline and the whole ""money, money, money is everything"". I got a ""free"" glass of water and went hungry. I then had a tight connection at ORD so had to get straight to the next gate (it said free soft drink is back with much fanfare, so yes, they must have tried to remove even that). I was pleased to see a new aircraft, but it ended there. The staff were such a mixed bunch, never seen a flight crew like it, it was almost as if they were volunteers. Anyway, they were nice enough, a million miles from a full service airline but reckon they gave all they could with their working conditions. Anyway my whole reason for writing this review is because of the food. Now I could feel the resentment from American Airlines. How dare they have to give free food out. What a shame so much of the transatlantic competitors do. I say free, of course it's in the ticket price but they call it complimentary. So by this point I'm starving and my kosher meal came. It blew my mind. One stale bun, crumbled in my hands. No butter or even spread, you'll have it dry. A side of sour shredded veg. I don't know, it was like coleslaw with no mayo and sat in vinegar for days on end until it wilted. Must have been the cheapest thing the catering firm had, it was beyond vile. Simply not edible. The teeny ""main"" was beyond it as well, little drops of pasta that were so overcooked it liquefied upon contact with tongue and tasted of nothing. Just unbelievable. The BBQ ""chicken"" was highly processed, bland and a perfect partner for the horror of it all. Maybe 5,000 flights, this was the most pathetic assortment of rubbish I'd ever been given. Then there was a tiny square of sponge with jam and coconut. I can't eat coconut but hey, the whole thing was vile. For ""breakfast"" the offering was so ridiculous I kindly asked the attendant to take it back. I had hoped for a full English, but thought I might get a warmed 7 day croissant, but no, it was a stale bun with no butter. The mainstream offering was a bag of dried cranberries which I can't eat, a mixed berry slice of muffin (don't expect a full muffin!). It doesn't sound so horrific, just cheap, but I can't eat dried fruit. I did eat the yogurt which American couldn't mess up. I left the first plane ravenous and the second chewing my knuckles. There were only two drinks served over the 7 hours of course. Paid a full service price and fobbed me off with this. They need to disassociate with that brand immediately.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LAS to LHR via ORD,January 2017,2,2,1,2,2,1,no
American Airlines,1,G Mears,5th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Tampa to San Francisco via Phoenix. Hands down the worst airline experience I have ever had. Almost every agent, flight attendant, and other airline staff were inefficient, disgruntled, or rude. I would never recommend this airline. On flight out we had a super old plane that was making all kinds of weird/loud noises. We were on the same plane out of Phoenix and they wouldn't take off with the noise so we returned to the gate and sat for over an hour and a half with no information on what was wrong (just the repeated ""technical issue"" update at about 15 mins intervals and no cabin service). The plane was completely powered off at one point which meant no lights/air for a period of time. When we finally made it to Tampa the power also went off as we were trying to de-board. Fast forward to the return flight and after waiting in a super long line, the curbside check-in didn't work and they wouldn't tell us why. Had to wait in another line to check our stroller inside and the agent there was convinced we were traveling to San Francisco, Costa Rica, not CA. Printed off boarding passes for Tampa and Phoenix in a horrible jumble which we were forced to sort ourselves at security with (at this point) screaming children in tow. Barely made the flight and we were at the airport almost 2 hours in advance. In Phoenix we discovered for some reason our boarding passes no longer had priority on them but group two. I had to wait at the counter for at least 15 mins (children now screaming again) while the agent completely ignored me, and when I was finally able to ask if we could board with priority as we had on every other leg I was very rudely interrupted as the agent said repeatedly, ""what's written on your boarding pass, what's written on your boarding pass?"" We were in the back of the plane that leg - with a four-year old and two-year old. Boarding in group 2 was an absolute nightmare and we held up a bunch of other people. We are also (or I should say were as of today) platinum card holders, but because my father booked the trip for us that didn't matter. At least the plane was newer on that leg, but super bare-bones for the age. Couldn't get the in-flight streaming option to work either (they only support for a limited number of browsers). I have never felt compelled to write an airline review before, but given this experience I felt compelled to warn future travelers (especially those with young children) that this is not the airline for you.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,TPA to SFO via PHX,January 2017,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

We departed on time and about 3.5 hours into a 5 hour flight the pilot announced that American Airlines had made a decision not to land in Vail do to a winter snow storm. Our plane was completely full of people heading for a ski trip. The incredible decision by AA to head back to Miami was crazy. No chance to deviate to Dallas or even Denver that was open. The entire plane was extremely upset on the poor choice and way of communication, with no regards for the huge investment on our vacation. Upon arrival back in Miami the entire plane, about several 100 people weren't assisted in any way by AA. After waiting almost an hour, they advised us to head to gate D37 a rebooking center, a nightmare of several hours that did not help. We ended up on a flight out of Miami to Charllotte that evening to head into Denver the next morning. We lost that night stay at our hotel in Vail, our lift ticket the following day and ski rental.

After an hour, we headed to the gate where we were told we were downgraded because they sold 20 first class tickets for 16 seats. Since we bought ours in March, they cost the least, therefore, we were downgraded. Here's a center seat and a $300 voucher, no drink voucher, no systemwide upgrade, but a promise of we'll provide you your drinks and meals onboard. I doubt they will.

American Airlines,1,T Peck,30th December 2016,"✅ Verified Review | Tokyo to Mexico City via Los Angeles. The inflight service was terrible; bad food, small servings, irresponsive crews, overcrowded lavatories, smaller aisle. This was all bearable until I reached Los Angeles for my 14 hours layover for my flight to Mexico city. The flight was suppose to depart at 23:55 at first, then delays of 20, 50, 120 minutes was announced until the flight was announced cancelled. Along with 6 other flights in LAX, American Airlines cancelled these flights altogether creating a mayhem in LAX. The airline has a customer service counter with 2 desks, just 2! And any other AA personnel you see in the airport are unwilling to answer any questions and they try to direct you to the service counter. When 7 flights are cancelled at one time, the queues to the counter are long, I mean 7-Hours long in the end. After getting reneged on your contract with AA to fly to your destination, you are forced to wait 7-hours to get an answer. So I did exactly that, and only then I knew it was because they had poor crew scheduling, resulting in insufficient crews to provide those flights. How is that even possible? With poor regulations of airline policies in the US, these airlines and airports are falling way behind with competitions from Middle East and Asia. So at the counter, I asked what do you have for me? The nonchalant service crew wasn't unsympathetic about our situation and just offered a replacement flight 3-days later - 3 days, 72-hours and told me there is nothing else they can do about it. Since I have my activities booked in Mexico city already, i have to pay a last-minute ticket to the city on my own which cost me $600 USD. American Airlines are unwilling to do anything about it and just asked me to collect my ""checked"" luggage which is left somewhere in the airport, without anyone overseeing it. To be honest, I read reviews about AA before buying the flight but did not know it can be this terrible.

American Airlines,1,Robert Mcshane,29th December 2016,✅ Verified Review | Orlando to Los Angeles. Utterly disappointed in American Airlines service. First the website told us all seats were taken except additional cost seats at $90. They made us check in at airport and stand in a long line of surly employees to be told that there were actually many available seats at no additional cost. Duplicitous and inconvenient. Next we were told no overheard space for carry ons was left and had to check our carry ons and pick them up at baggage claim. Also ridiculous. AA knows exactly how many people and bags they have - they only run out of space by letting people fill overhead bins with jackets etc. Irresponsible. I would try hard never to fly with these unhappy employees nor this third rate airline. On a humanistic note: there was a Spanish speaking woman in line next to us who was repeatedly dismissed and sent to the back of the line because no one would bother to call one of the many bilingual employees to assist her.

After already checking in and going through security, I switched to an earlier flight and was assured by a really nice guy on phone that my bag could be transferred, all I needed to do was speak to an agent here at the airport. Only problem is there wasn't a single agent at any of the desks, including customer service. I finally found an agent behind the Cuba desk and she told me I couldn't switch baggage in domestic flights. So I booked a reservation, paid a fee under the impression by baggage could arrive with me because of contradictory beliefs on a basic, fundamental policy, which should have been explained before I booked my new flight. I called customer service and they said they would not refund me the baggage fee for the inconvenience of coming back to the airport at 1AM to pick up my luggage. She told me to find a different agent and see what could be done. When I found another agent she was on the phone speaking to a friend in Spanish and popping her gum, ignored me for three minutes, then told me to have a seat and be patient for the agent who will arrive in 30 minutes.

I had to get another connecting flight in Chicago which did not leave until 9:40p.m. I did not reach Dayton until 11:53p.m. I spent over 12 hours in an airport, was not offered any compensation, and I had nothing to eat because I could not afford it and I thought I would be to my destination earlier.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BNA to DAY via IAD,December 2016,3,4,,,1,1,no

The day of my flight, I was there 2 hrs early only to be informed that my flight was canceled 10 min before my arrival. So instead, American Airlines assigned me a new route which required me to stop in Dallas and then onto San Antonio. The plane was not ready for flight so we had to wait another 2hrs. This is not my worst experience with flying but still, it's the fact of the matter. If I showed up late to my flight, canceled, or had to switch, American Airlines would charge me for that mistake.

American Airlines,3,M Demitroff,20th December 2016,"✅ Verified Review | My red-eye flight from Philadelphia to San Francisco with American Airlines was supposed to be nonstop. Upon arrival to the boarding gate, the American posting board still read nonstop, and only at last minute were we informed that the plane would make a fuel stop in Kansas City. As this was a full flight, there was no overhead space for my carry-on so there I was stuck having to jam my luggage and backpack under the seat with no place for my feet. We sat on the ground for an hour, and ultimately arrived 2-hours late at our destination. A review of the AA615 activity log indicates this is not an uncommon occurrence. Some missed connections, I missed a lunch meeting. It is unacceptable to have an airline presumably save a few bucks on fuel at their passengers' expense.

Last time I was on an American flight we were in the air from Dallas to Lubbock and we had to go back to Dallas and de-plane because of mechanical issues or something. Time before that my bag got lost because my plane from Lubbock to Dallas was delayed and I had to run to my next flight. I'm so sick of American Airlines.

American Airlines,1,Sarah Hakola,18th December 2016,"New York JFK to Akron–Canton via Charlotte. Over the past two months I have been traveling through Europe and taken countless flights, but this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. To begin with, the boarding procedure was delayed because the previous flight arrived late. After getting the plane ready the crew boarded us about 30 minutes after our original boarding time. Everyone got on the aircraft and sat and waited for a long time before being told they were experiencing mechanical issues and they were bringing people in to check out the situation. We sat and waited and then were finally told that if we would like to get off the plane we were welcome to. I proceeded to leave the plane to speak with an agent because I knew that I was going to miss my connecting flight in CLT. There was one travel agent available for a whole airplane of people and she seemed to care less about helping us because her shift was supposed to be ending. I asked if I could change my end destination to a larger airport that was within 300 miles of my original end point and I was told no. The only option they could give me was a flight out the next day. I took the new flight information and proceeded to call the service number where I was told the exact opposite information that the travel agent at the airport told me. However, there is nothing that the agents over the phone can do because they cannot physically give you a new boarding pass or vouchers to make up for the inconvenience. By the time I was about to get back in line to speak with the travel agent in person and inform her of what I was told on the phone, there was a line of about 20 people. I went back to the gate and was told to re-board the plane if we had new boarding passes and had been situated on a new flight out of CLT. I got back on the plane and sat for all of five minutes to be told that their flight crew had timed out and a new crew would not arrive for at least another hour. We once again had to exit the plane and go sit by the gate. They did provide us some snacks while we waited and the crew did not arrive until 2 hours later. There was still only one travel agent available to assist passengers who needed to re-book their flights and the customer support agents were impatient, rude, and acted as though this was our problem and not their own. I do not remember hearing the words ""I am sorry for the inconvenience"" once out of anybody. After sitting until 1:00am they finally had a crew and boarded us for a third time on the plane. It took forever to take off and we landed in CLT at about 3:30am. We were told we would receive hotel vouchers, transportation, and food once in CLT. Clearly JFK did not communicate the issues to CLT because the members in Charlotte had no idea what was going on and we had to wait another hour for a supervisor to come out and speak to us. At this point, there was no point in getting a hotel voucher because flights would be leaving within a few hours. I finally spoke with an agent who put me on an earlier flight to a different airport that was close to my original destination. He also provided me with a food voucher. This was the first time that I received answers and was helped in a caring and apologetic way. This was also the first time that I was not quickly shut down and told no. I finally made it home after many hours, many tears, and lots of frustration. The lack of support and concern for their passengers is ridiculous and I will never fly AA again.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,JFK to CAK via CLT,December 2016,3,3,1,,1,1,no
American Airlines,2,Sarah Chaikind,18th December 2016,"Baltimore to Miami with American Airlines. This was one of the worst flight experiences I had ever had. Our flight was meant to leave at 530 am and due to icy weather conditions, we were delayed 6 hours. Although the staff were kind, we ended up waiting on the aircraft for hours with little to no information. When we finally took off, about an hour into the flight the pilot informed us that due to a mechanical malfunction we would have to make an emergency landing in Jacksonville (intended destination = Miami.) Again captain and crew were great - no complaints. Once we landed, we were told very little about the prognosis of our aircraft and we ended up having to wait in a huge group of 160 people as we learned very slowly that the flight could not be officially cancelled until they were certain they couldn't find a replacement captain and crew, but also couldn't help us rebook a new flight to make connections. Thus, this all resulted in zero contingency plan and lots of unnecessary waiting. When we finally departed for Miami at 1030 pm on the original aircraft with a new captain and crew, we were promised hotel and transportation vouchers upon our arrival in MIA. However when we arrived, the line to receive these vouchers was hundreds of people long with no end in sight. I (along with hundreds of other passengers) were extremely disappointed with the lack of organization or a streamlined process.",Boeing 737,Family Leisure,Economy Class,BWI to MIA,December 2016,3,4,,,1,2,no

Simply walking up to the kiosk to ask them if we could upgrade our seats (6 hours in advanced) we were told don't bother unless it's 24 hours in advanced. ""It doesn't matter unless it's done 24 hours in advanced. You will not get your request."" The interesting part of this was, we only walked up to the kiosk to ask them if it was a possibility to upgrade our seats. We weren't expecting it, only asking if it was a possibility. Interestingly enough, the American Airlines attendant told us there was not point in talking to them unless we did it 24 hours in advanced. I don't care about that. I just wanted to ask.

American Airlines,4,Davide Greco,16th December 2016,"Chicago to Miami. As every year I flew to Miami after attending a medical congress in Chicago so used my AAdvantage points to book a free flight to Florida on November 30th. As I am aware some American Airlines planes are very old I usually try to book a flight operated by some newish Boeing 737-800 which are very common on this route: this year I wanted to fly business class (they call it First but it's just a trick) so I had limited options for ny reward ticket and I ended up in a 4:40pm flight. They changed the plane to a B757 a few weeks after my booking so in the end my flight was operated by a glorious aircraft from the '80s with extremely wide but hard seats with limited recline capability. Because of a technical issue, departure was delayed for about one hour (this happened in about 40% of all the flights I had with AA so far, kind of disturbing if you compare with other major airlines) but no big deal as I was not in a hurry. No PTV on the seat just the old fashioned hanging monitor with terrible sound and video quality, so bad they even had to interrupt the safety video because it was a torture for our ears. Flight was uneventful with a pleasant purser who greeted passengers one by one by shaking their hands both upon boarding and before landing. I did not feel like eating so did not try the meal which did look fine by the way (chicken with some vegetables). The one and only positive thing about this trip was I paid 5USD: not sure I will repeat the experience though, unless I am absolutely sure I can fly on a more recent aircraft with better and modern features.",Boeing 757-200,Business,Business Class,ORD to MIA,November 2016,2,3,,,3,5,no

I was supposed to leave at 1.15 and now they are estimating that my flight will leave at 4.20. If there is another delay I will have to move my connecting flight to a later time once again. The attendants at the counter are being very rude and extremely unhelpful. I am just waiting for the next delay/the next thing to go wrong.

American Airlines,9,Alan Wan,13th December 2016,"✅ Verified Review | I was flying MIA to LHR via JFK with American Airlines. This review is for the MIA-JFK route. I was originally booked onto a 757, international configuration with angled lie flat seats. However I took the opportunity to do a same day flight change and get an earlier flight, this would enable me to do a quick bit of shopping. Additionally the change of flight allowed me to sample a reconfigured 767, with the lie flat seats. I arrived at MIA at 6.45am for my 9.26am departure. There was no queue for the Priority check-in and I just needed to pick up my boarding passes as I was hand bag only. The check-in associate was friendly and helpful. I had access to fast track security and I was through in 5 minutes. I used the Admirals Club at Gate 30. It was a pretty pathetic offering, unlike the AA First class lounge at JFK which is excellent. The AC had a very limited free breakfast offering and I had a bagel and coffee. I was provided with a single drinks voucher which I used to get a bottle of water for the flight. Boarding commenced on time at precisely 8.56am - 30 minutes before departure. After people with access needs boarded, First class passengers were invited to board. On boarding a FA offered to hang my coat and I was offered a pre departure drink and I selected coffee. On international legs, a Samsung tablet is provided, but only main screen entertainment was offered on this short 2.5 hour flight. I was provided with in ear headphones. The seat was excellent, fully flat with plenty of space. I was seated in 6D, I would have preferred a window but none where available at checkin. I would have been happy with this seat on an international sector, so felt spoilt for a short domestic flight. The FA who looked after me was great, friendly, attentive and address me by my name. Cereal or a three cheese omelette were on offer. I chose the latter which was definitely the most popular choice. The omelette and the sausage provided were not great, but the side veggies and biscuit were excellent. After eating I promptly fell asleep for the remainder of the flight. Overall besides the poor lounge offering, this was an excellent domestic flight.",Boeing 767,Solo Leisure,Business Class,MIA to JFK,December 2016,5,5,4,3,4,5,yes

The first thing I noticed that made American Airlines different to any of the other airlines I have flown with was the unfriendly, unsmiling and unhelpful staff. Second huge difference was the customer service, which does not exist. I had only one carry on bag with me, which I usually fly with have never had any problems bringing it on board. American Airlines stewardess told me to leave my carry on bag because it was too big even though I saw passengers in front of me passing with no problems with carry on bags far bigger than mine. The rest of the flight was just same, unfriendly and careless. At the end of our flight we were offered to buy American Airlines point cards.

You also cannot pay extra to upgrade to a seat with extra leg room.

American Airlines,4,Kent R Smith,11th December 2016,"Very glad to finally have nonstop service to and from JFK. The service on the return flight from JFK to Tucson in Economy Preferred seating was non existent. Monday 8:00 PM departure on November 22nd from JFK to Tucson, immediate announcement from the cockpit that we could expect air turbulence and the seat belt sign would remain on the entire flight. We encountered three or four slight bumps mid flight, that was it totally smooth flying. Since the seat belt sign was pre determined to stay on it gave the entire plane, except first class no cabin service on the five plus hour flight. The other major uncomfortable problem was the cabin temperature was around 80 degrees and yet there was no one to ask about getting air turned down. No one approached any of the passengers on this five plus hour flight. I arrived Tucson soaked with sweat and dehydrated from no fluid. The first thing I did the next day was cancel the future flights I had booked on American. I realize the airline is working hard to make a comeback, they still have a lot of problems and created a very unpleasant flight back from a long weekend in NYC.

We were delayed by 2 hours due to a technical issue and there was no update from the captain on whether or not we would make up the time. Check in and airport staff in JFK need to learn some customer service skills. No smiling, rude people that generally look fed up in life and with their job. They sigh, they roll their eyes.
