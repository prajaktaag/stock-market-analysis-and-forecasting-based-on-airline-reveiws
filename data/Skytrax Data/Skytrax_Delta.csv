Delta Air Lines,1,Blade Edwards,27th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Charleston to Atlanta. I had a round trip with one lay over each way. I flew from SLC to LAX just fine, but when I flew from LAX to Orlando, I sat on the plane waiting for takeoff because there seemed to be issues with the plane. It ended up taking 2 hrs before we were able to take off, which is fine I understand things happen, and I’m glad it got taken care of (not to mention it pushed back all my plans and was very inconvenient.) Now, I’m heading back home and am making arrangements to get picked up, etc when I hear on the intercom that we can’t depart because there are more issues and it’s going to at least take an hour? Does this happen often? I’ve flown many times with other airlines, and have never experienced this, let alone back to back.

Delta Air Lines,1,T Huang,27th September 2018,✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco to Los Angeles. This is the worst nightmare. I do consider not flying delta again. First the system was down and the fly delay 40 mins at the gate. Then when we started boarding the gate attendant insisted that I tucked my 2inch x 4inch clutch inside my bag because it is the third bag. Then we proceed on to the plane and noticed that due to runway conflict we are now going to wait for another 40mins inside the airplane. Or at least that is the minimum estimate of wait wait time.

Delta Air Lines,1,Meredith Page,26th September 2018,"Not Verified | Detroit to Portland. My new boyfriend and i booked oir first trip together a month and a half ago, tickets booked at the same time, in one transaction, and of course we asked and assumed we would be seated together. There were plenty of open seats at the time, and when we got on the plane we were seperated, different rows and different sides, among a bunch of passengers flying solo that insisted on staying put, for no damn reason. Got our trip off to a lousy start, for absolutely no reason, such a basic thing, they scammed us, and it was completely unnecessary. I will never, never fly this hack airline again, and I recommend that you dont either, they clearly have no concern for their customers comfort or satisfaction.

My 83 yrs old mother was on this airline that was later reported rescheduled after I called delta airline customer service that lasted about 20 minutes. This is a terrible experience for all involved, firstly my mother is wheel chair assisted and does not speak english she was just sitting in Atlanta on a wheel chair on a spot not knowing what a heck was going on. I was waiting at Washington Dulles airport not knowing what was going on until i called the customer service and found out that the particular flight has been rescheduled without been warned. Not only that the man that was assigned to wheel mother at the Atlanta airport was actually demanding money from older lady just coming from Nigeria without local currency.

It was long and miserable. We waited in line and communication was poor from the staff. But, Delta did redeem themselves today, and they are sending me a check to cover the hotel room I paid for out of pocket that fateful night. Too bad they didn't cover the $50 taxi bill to the hotel, or the $50 in baggage fees, but at least they made good on the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised by the good training and demeanor of staff.

Delta Air Lines,2,Shubham Bakshi,12th September 2018,"Not Verified | Delta has to be the most inefficient and useless flight in hurricane situation. I was flying from Boston to Greensboro, NC for a job interview on Friday when the hurricane is supposed to hit the region. My employer canceled the interview, but since they did not cancel the flight, I was told that this is voluntary change that I am making. Additionally, I had to fly before September 20th, since the ""bulletin"" board mentioned that is the law. 2 flaws in these statements: A bulletin board cannot determine that my flight needs to be on a certain date because that is when my employer wants to interview. I would love to fly before September 20th, but I cannot do that- that is impossible from my employer's perspective. When it is supposed to rain 20 inches and since you have not canceled the flight, does not mean that flight will not fly. Just because you dont cancel the flight does not mean that the hazard of the hurricane goes away. Extremely rude customer representatives who would argue with me about my own thought process, would not let me finish the sentence and would keep on going on and on about this supposed bulletin board that is their law. I have been a customer with Delta for over 10 years, but would not fly with them ever again.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Greensboro,September 2018,,,,,1,1,no
Delta Air Lines,1,Tom Hoyt,7th September 2018,"Not Verified | I'm told that I have to check my bag, that all overhead bins are completely full. I get to my seat and there is a completely empty bin at my seat. When your customers pay you hundreds of dollars for a seat, they expect space for the overhead bin. Especially when there actually is space available. Not wanting to lose essentials, I frantically attempted to move items to my backpack from my carry on, breaking the zipper in the process.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,McCarren to Kalispell,September 2018,3,1,,,1,1,no
Delta Air Lines,4,H Stowe,7th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | My family just traveled from Ft. Myers to Atlanta round trip on Delta. We purchased 5 economy tickets for 2 adults and 3 children. When we checked in for the first flight to ATL the counter personnel made a snide comment about our tickets being basic economy and how lucky we were to have seats in the same row. For this first leg we had 5 seats in row 40 with 1 other passenger between us. That was good and we had a fine flight. When I used the Delta mobile app to check in for our return flight to RSW, we were given 5 middle seats (737 seats b and e) throughout the plane. We didn't get 2 seats together. When travelling with children (9, 12, and 14) that is not disastrous, but still sucks. When I asked the Atlanta check in staff if there was anything they could do for us, that is when I really experienced how Delta feels about basic economy tickets. The check in person was very friendly and helpful until he saw what type of fare we had purchased. His demeanor and helpfulness completely changed as he informed us that our tickets were take any seat class. We went to customer service and received the same treatment, even after telling the rep the ages of our girls. At the gate we tried again, and this gentleman was even more discourteous. He told us he wouldn't even look to see if there were seats available for moving us. When we got on the plane (last - zone 4), several passengers saw our predicament and offered to move to accommodate us. We didn't ask them to. Nice to see there are good people flying on Delta even if the people running it are jerks. We fly often and usually on Frontier, Allegiant, Jet Blue, and Southwest Airlines without difficulty. No other airline has embarrassed me or belittled me for choosing to fly economy with them. Bottom line is, if you buy a published basic economy fare on Delta Airlines, be prepared to be admonished and treated like you don't deserve to be on their plane.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Fort Myers,September 2018,4,5,4,5,1,3,no
Delta Air Lines,3,Sherri Walls,7th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | I booked a first class trip for two on Delta Airlines using my Delta Sky-miles Platinum Card. We were flying from La Guardia to Houston. It’s about a four hour flight. For me, any flight over two hours I tend to fly first class. Unless, the ticket value is exceptional. Although I’ve held this card for sometime now, I’ve only flown first class twice on Delta. I generally use Delta to fly to Atlanta, which is approximately two hours. Anyway, the trip began with the rep at the gate informing us that we wouldn’t be able to sit together due to a broken seat. I was like that blows but whatever. Then I thought to ask the Delta Rep if maybe they could simply inquire with the passenger; who one of would be sat next to, if they didn’t mind switching to a different seat (still in first class but with no on occupying the seat next to it). I was told by the Delta Rep, that I should do it myself. Which, if that’s their policy, I get! He offered no other remedy. Maybe he could’ve said: hey, I realize it’s a bit of an inconvenience, separating you and if it’s important for you to be seated together; I could move you but you’d be losing first class service (which is much on Delta anyway). I just felt that there was no regard for professionalism. It matter of fact and deal with it attitude. The kicker was this, we boarded the plane and the “first class” Stewardess was no prize either. I will give this though, she did assist in getting us seated together. She then took drink and food orders. My order was taken first. Apparently, too many people ordered the chicken salad dish. She came back to me and here’s the dialogue: I can’t give you the chicken dish, you’ll have to have the pastrami sandwich. I said well I’ll pass, because I don’t eat pastrami. But how does that work anyway, you told me my choices and I selected like everyone else? She says we ran out of the chicken. I say, but you took my order first? She says well in looking at the medallion status, you fall to the bottom. What was so crazy about that is that I purchased both first class tickets and she brings my boyfriend the chicken salad! We both laughed like hell! Again, to her defense it could only be the Delta Airline to blame. No ideal how she decided he got to eat over me though. There is clearly no training on tact or etiquette. And if I’m wrong in that statement; there is either no policy in place for common occurrences. The whole point of this review is to hopefully save anyone from wasting money on Delta first class. I’ve flown first class on American Airlines quite a few times also and have had zero complaints. Their planes even appear to be nicer. The meal thing wouldn't happen either as you select it 30 days to 24 hours before your flight. I’ll be getting rid of the Delta card.

Delta Air Lines,1,Amparo Reyes,6th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Santiago. I will never chose Delta to fly again. I paid for a very expensive ticket and I was treated very unfair. I was given no respect and was given no attention as a customer. I was seated twice on the plane and both times had to leave the plane because of some excuses. First they said the plane had some mechanical issues, then they said the pilot had just came from a 10 hour flight and was tired. Then they said we couldn’t leave because of bad weather, which was a complete cover up for everything else. I spent more than 24 hours at the airport and even had to sleep on the floor.

Rebooked on next day midday as ""there were no more first class seats on the 8.30am flight"". No hotel accommodation or food was arranged and Delta Sky Priority staff at counter told that there would be no reimbursement because the flight cancellation was due to ""poor weather"".

Delta Air Lines,1,Bruna Scorsatto,1st September 2018,"Not Verified | I took the flight DL422 from Sao Paulo to Berlin on August 14th with a 8 hour layover in New York. The first part of the trip was ok but unfortunately I can't say the same about the NY-Berlin portion. The flight was delayed in more than one hour and when I got to Berlin I found out my luggage had been lost. I didn't receive any support from Delta, instructions on what to do, if they were trying to track my luggage, anything. Everything I had was on my dispatched luggage, I had nothing but my passport, wallet and camera on me. When I complained about not getting any support from them, an employee gave me a toiletry kit with a small tooth brush and some shaving cream and sent me to the lost and found area of Tegel airport. After waiting in line for almost 2 hours, I was told there was nothing they could do and I should fill out a form online with my personal information and if they found my bag, they would contact me. When I tried to talk to Delta employees again, I discovered there were none at the airport anymore (it was 3 pm) and there was no one at the airport I could talk about my situation. On the following day, I returned to the airport to try to solve the situation with a Delta employee and I was told my luggage had arrived on the flight from New York that was landing at that time but they couldn't hand me my bag because it had to go through customs. After that, I kept receiving emails saying my luggage was still lost and couldn't be tracked and I should be patient. My luggage was only delivered on Wednesday of the following week. At any point I was not contacted by Delta airlines with instructions, received any support or voucher to pay for the extra expenses I had to have or even an apology note. Having spent half of my time in Berlin without my luggage seriously impacted my time there as I was always concerned that my luggage might be delivered while I was out of the house. I didn't stay at a hotel and the building didn't have a doorman and no one would be there to pick it up. I was worried about not having my things back at all as I kept getting emails saying they had no idea where my luggage was, was always uncomfortable from wearing clothes borrowed from friends and generally just stressed out by the lack of care toward me from Delta.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sao Paulo to Berlin via New York,August 2018,1,3,3,2,1,1,no

While all other airlines cancelled all flights, Delta saw it was safe to still fly in and out a little longer until the bad weather hit. The storm was about to hit us so Delta moved up the departure time about 20 minutes so we could make it out safely. We made it out of there with no complications, barely even any turbulence.

Except when one decided it was ok to tell me that I’d be much prettier if I didn’t have on my beanie hat. But I degress. My sole complaint is about every single solitary employee I came in contact with whether at ticketing or the gate. All of them were unwelcoming, stood with a sour look on their face, had a lack of personality and enthusiasm for their jobs, didn’t make customers feel appreciated and made me feel like I was bothering them if I asked them a question. Whew! From someone who is in the hospitality industry and understands the importance of customer service, Delta receives a big fat F!

I was supposed to be rebooked on this flight due to an AA flight being extremely delayed because of weather. AA was extremely helpful and friendly while getting us re booked on a Delta flight since all other AA flights were sold out. Success! So we thought. Delta was too incompetent to figure out the new reservation, even after we gave them the new confirmation number and showed them the email we received from Delta conforming our new flight - once Delta figured out what was going on (they took too long) and then said the flight just closed and we were no longer allowed to check in. Now we had no flight home and had to start all over again. When asked to speak with a Delta supervisor, we were told that one was not available and because the guy was only a trainee he couldn’t help us.

This airline is horrible. My most recent experience yesterday (8/22/18) we sat on the runway for 30 mins and I missed my connection. Now we are sitting here again after landing finally in New York. This time there’s some excuse about something breaking down. It’s such a joke. Very frustrating.

From there they would not let me take my checked bag off the plane, even though they were switching planes and I notified them I would be booking a ticket with another airline from ATL since they tardiness caused me to miss my flight to Ireland at JFK.

We asked if we can move our layover flight earlier as delays started to appear they said if it's not 90 min they can't or we have to pay 400 usd in total for a flight change. We decided its not worth it. So we took our original flight next morning which has been replayed since 5 am. Its been delayed with no explanation again and again. The staff at delays usa is completely rude. Do not answer questions i mean who is training them? Do they even get training?

They talked and came up with a plan, since it was early in the morning and we are close to Chicago (~8am), they tried to help me get to Chicago Passport Agency (closed at 3pm) and have my passport renewed on the same day. So that they booked me a ticket to Chicago and rebooked my trips for the next early morning leaving from Chicago all for free!

Delta Air Lines,1,Y Johnson,16th August 2018,"Not Verified | My recent flight from JFK New York to Sacramento via Atlanta was 24 hours from hell. Despite my efforts in trying to remain optimistic, experiencing disappointment after disappointment, I had to choice but to just be upset. I flew out of JFK on a rainy day, therefore all of the Delta flights were delayed. I found it curious that the online airline that experienced delayed take-offs was Delta that day, but what can you do? The delay would make me miss my second flight I need to get to my final destination. When I spoke to a Delta employee about re-navigating my flight, I was given very half-invested attention. From making jokes constantly with her fellow employee, to forgetting what she was searching for, she ended up booking me on my original flight in hopes we would make up time in the air. I just went with it, trusting a professional opinion over my own. Of course the flight was delayed even more and I missed my flight and the second option she put me on standby for. Delta accommodated me with a hotel and meal voucher. I the next available flight from Atlanta to Sacramento the next morning. Not anything you can do at this point. As inconvenient as this was, this is not the part of my Delta experience that really put me off. After finally arriving to Sacramento, I only an item that was at the top of one of my bags was missing and my other bag was missing altogether. When I finally received my second bag at home that night via their delivery service, the wheel was completely broken off and the side of my baggage had a big hole in it. Can't recommend this airline after receiving my belongings in such a state.

The flight was delayed to the point I was late for the wedding. There was absolutely no customer service. Every employee I talked to trying to get a different flight just blew me off. One actually told me I should have booked with another airline because all the Delta flights are late. She was correct. Every single flight has been delayed. Its cost me a total of over 8 hours of layover time. What a joke. Awful customer service and nothing but late flights.

There were mild showers for 30 mins or so, but most other airlines were operating, even Delta had another flight 4 hrs later on the same day to same destination. They could have delayed the flight by 2-3 hrs, but they cancelled it and booked a flight for 14th morning. It will throw off all my subsequent plans (extended hotel stay in New York, plans in BUF and flight booked from BUF back to NYC).

The checked bag will be charged for 25USD for the first bag when checked in. My bag was 55 lbs which is a bit exceed the allowance. I asked the staff to repack my bag, removing something out and re-scale the weight. She blamed me and talked many words. She wanted me to pay the heavy-bag charge just because to complete everything quickly. Then I gave up and let her charge the fee. She completed printing the tag and receipt and said ""a hundred dollars"". I have just known the fee at that moment. She never informed the fee before. 100USD is about 80% of my ticket price. My friends checked-in at the counter beside. Staff advised them to re-pack. She was very polite and helpful. Poor me, wrong counter, changed the experience. On cabin experience, everything went very well. Thai cabin crew on board was very very nice. She was very helpful, respectful and service-minded. All other crews were also nice.

Delta Air Lines,3,F Chilton,13th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Raleigh Durham to New York. This has been the worst flying experience. In fact, we never actually ended up flying and did not make it to our destination. We were originally booked to fly to NYC on August 4th and back on August 5th for a weekend trip, and that flight was delayed for 2 hours and then cancelled after a very short time, and I'm about 99% sure this was due to a mechanical issue. We rebooked for the next weekend on the same flights (August 11th-August 12th), and the gate agent was willing to upgrade us to first class. Sounds great, right? I guess it would've if that had actually worked out. That flight was delayed for 3 hours and then cancelled AGAIN. Now, this time, it was due to weather, which they can't control; however, this is the first time I've been cancelled due to weather. In the past, I've been delayed for a long time, but not cancelled. We rebooked on another flight, this was 3 hours later, and it gets delayed due to weather/late inbound flight, and once it finally makes it to the gate, we get ready to board, and then the gate agent announces that the flight was cancelled again literally just as the plane is about to board. Some airlines like to keep delaying the flight and are really hesitant to cancel, where as Delta just decides to give up and cancel the flights. We went back to the counter and asked to rebook and there was one agent there who was literally the opposite of helpful, and he kept asking us to wait a minute, and then stand back, and to give priority to the people on the Paris flight, and my dad had to call his attention by saying, ""Don't worry about us. We're just customers going to go to New York,"" and the one woman that was standing next to him gave another sarcastic remark, and then they walked away. We waited an hour and a half on the phone to ask if we could be reimbursed. They were willing to give us our money back. I've flown Delta many times without incident, but I have to say I was quite disappointed this time. I'm not saying I won't fly them again because I will, but this was an experience that really let me down. They are usually good to us, but this was an experience that I won't soon forget. My ratings for Value for money and Ground service are based on this trip. My ratings for Seat comfort and Cabin Staff service can't apply for this trip because we never actually made it into the air or even on the plane, so they are based on past experiences with Delta.",Embraer 175,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham to New York,August 2018,4,4,,,1,2,no
Delta Air Lines,1,T Hayne,13th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Austin to Seattle. Baggage handling was completely incompetent. I checked in online and printed my boarding pass, but it took 35 minutes in a huge long line simply to drop off my bag in Austin. After arriving in Seattle, it took one full hour after the flight reached the gate before I got my bag!! From what the staff told me, the bags were unloaded from the airplane but no one was there to deliver them to the baggage claim area. We were all standing around waiting for our bags and it took a very long time for the staff to figure out what happened. Finally I got my bag and was given a ticket for some bonus miles, but the agent did not tell me that I only had 3 days to claim them. I waited until I returned home a week later, and by then it was too late to get the miles. The flight was expensive and uncomfortable The 6:40 am departure time was too early. And wasting over 1.5 hours of my time on dropping off and collecting my suitcase was inexcusable.

Delta Air Lines,1,S Branson,12th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Boston to New York. Absolutely terrible, they cancelled my flight less than 12 hours before I was supposed to leave via text. I had no other options to fly out of the same airport, so I had to switch to another airport almost an hour away. My return flight home was returning to the airport I had originally booked with and if I wanted to change that flight it would cost me more money since that flight was not cancelled. A whole bunch of phone calls and issues 3 hours later I had my new flight, but needed to now book a car to drive me since my car could be in Boston MA when I was flying back to Manchester NH. $150 later I had the ride, but the hassle of all this was not fun.

Delays have certainly become more of an issue with them yet we have continued to remain loyal. Flew out of Atlanta to Amsterdam to cruise for 13 days. Arrived in AMS, no bags. No explanation of where our bags were. Filed our missing bags report with KLM baggage office. Made several phone calls every day trying to track down our missing luggage. Call after call, lie after lie. Total disregard and lack of follow through. After day 6 I really started to panic when my husband received an email from Delta saying that our bags were delivered to us and the file was closed. No joke. I started calling like a maniac at this point. KLM and Delta - all different stories. Our bags showed up on day 11 of our 13-day cruise. Our trip was ruined.

Delta Air Lines,1,E Huang,9th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Pittsburgh operated by Delta. A nightmare. After 21-hour flying from Asia to JFK with my little kids, a 7 year and a 2 year old, we supposed to have only 3 hours layover at JFK and a 2 hour flight to get home. The last flight was delayed totally 12 hours including 1 hour in plane. The nightmare was, they extended the delay every hour and then every 20 minutes and they changed the gate for almost every time. We had to stay in the terminal, moved every time they extended the delay and changed gate. Our kids could not take a rest after 21 hours flying from Asia. They slept while sitting on the ground, in the crowd, in front of the gate to wait. I talked to Delta reps, they said ""sorry"" and turned their back. I did not see that they cared or felt sorry. It is the word they use to avoid troubles. It was not only our flight. Delta's terminal was a mess with many flights canceled, delayed, changed gate. We used to have problems with Delta. If there was another choice, we did not travel with Delta. Value for money - No. Cost to fly with Delta is not low. Ground service - Delta attendants are robots. They do not care.

The flight was cancelled due to technical issues, and Delta rebooked me via Air France to Munich, and then via Lufthansa from Munich to Delhi. Nobody however thought of these 3 things when rebooking me. France needs a schengen transit visa when changing the airports. I of course did not have that. I was denied boarding to Munich due to this. I would need new boarding passes from Air France and Lufthansa. Since this was a rebooking, the PNR changed. Delta did not provide me with that, and I had to run back & forth between counters in CDG airport to find Air France counters to give me the boarding pass. There was an available flight from Paris to Mumbai, but Delta did not book me on that. I eventually reached via CDG-DXB-DEL. The DXB-DEL was via Emirates, which was a pleasure.

I also observed the ground staff to be rude, and unhelpful to elderly passengers.

There were a lot of us traveling and my brothers San Diego flight took off within minutes of them unloading our plane. The captain said the crew on our plane would time out in the air to Las Vegas so they just cancelled our flight. My in laws on a flight to Phoenix were also brought back to the terminal because their captain timed out. The best delta could do was get us home by midnight the next night via a ton of transfers but couldn’t leave jfk until 2 the next afternoon as all flights were sold out. Then I find a San Diego flight that was supposed to leave at 7:25 but it’s delayed until 12:40 so we get that flight because it’s close enough. The soonest they can get us out of San Diego is 5 pm. I’m on the phone with delta and the lady talks to me for over 20 minutes. Most of the time on hold. I walked to the gate and asked the ticket agent about getting on the flight he gets us passes before this lady can get me off hold. Not sure what she could have possibly been doing. I decided to purchase tickets on southwest because now I’m getting home on Saturday and I leave again on Tuesday. We are returning from a 3 week trip and just want to be home.

The flight attendant says she will check when she gets a second—she was a little frantic over whether a pilot was actually coming. No one helps me so I try to sleep. Get up to use the bathroom and see the entire coach class with blankets and pillows. When I ask again, they are all out. The in laws were loaded on a plane to Atlanta, driven out to the taxi way and then brought back to the gate because the pilot timed out. Why even put the people on the plane?? They can cry weather all they want but the flight I got on had their entire crew time out so they pulled another crew and put them on this flight so we could take off. It’s interesting how forth coming these people are with their information. This crew could have been given to the vegas flight. I can’t see how it’s cost effective to strand 100’s of people.

After waiting all day for our 6:40pm flight we were informed it was delayed over four hours and we would miss our layover flight from Atlanta to Dayton because of it. So they gave us standby tickets for an earlier flight (from Orlando to Atlanta) that was already overbooked; when I asked about getting a hotel room at the Orlando airport for the night and just traveling in the morning I was told they wouldn’t cover any of the costs and that we needed to take our original flight to Atlanta if we couldn’t get on any earlier flights and for the second time we were put on standby for yet another overbooked flight (they offered $600 to people to give up seats) because they were already overbooked.

Finally we boarded our very delayed flight to Atlanta after being at the airport for over 13 hours when we arrived in Atlanta at 1am there was no one to help us find a hotel or somewhere to sleep so I went to the help phone to ask them. The delta help lady on the phone informed me we weren’t even secheduled for any flights from Atlanta to Dayton!!!!! She went ahead and set the flight up for us (she was the only helpful person; she also informed me that the closets place to stay was not within walking distance) so we had to nap in chairs at Atlanta airport until our 8:10am flight. Then our 8:10 flight got delayed another two and a half hours so here we sit we have been at the airport for over 24 hours with absolutely no accommodations (besides one nice worker NOT with Delta that brought us blankets and snacks at 2am because everything was closed and she was off of work for the night). This mornings flight is said to be delayed due to weather however when I tracked the plane it is still at its last destination where the weather is clear....we do have rain in Atlanta however all the other planes are arriving and departing just fine!

Delta Air Lines,2,C Plumber,21st July 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Tampa. Recently I decided to start using Delta Airlines. It was a fairly last minute trip so I scheduled a flight from Detroit to Tampa and paid around $450. I scheduled the 8:20 PM because I didn't know what time I would be done with work. It turned out my assignment ended early so I got to the airport at 1PM to try to get on a 3:30PM flight. At first I was informed there would be a $75 fee to change to the earlier flight which was fine with me and well worth it. Then after looking up my fare the Delta employee told me that I could not change the flight because I had an economy fare. The only option was to buy a new ticket for close to $500 on the 3:30 flight. I asked if I could go standby they said no. I asked if there was anything I could do to get on the earlier flight short of paying another full fare. They said ""sorry but you purchasd the cheap fare and Delta tries to make as much as they can."" So the 3:30 flight was delayed until 4:45. I hung around hoping I could get on the flight. I tried again and Delta said that if the 8:20 is delayed then they would allow me to get on the earlier flight. I asked them to check and they said it was not delayed - sorry. Once everyone boarded the earlier flight I tried again and they said they could not put me on the flight even though there was plenty of extra seats. The later flight is not delayed and that is the only way they would allow it. The flight left. Not 10 minutes goes by and I get an email saying the 8:20 is delayed. Delta Airlines does not care about accommodating its passengers. They could have put me on that earlier flight and made an extra $75 but they chose to be greedy and make me sit in the airport for another 4 hours. My flight has been delayed to 8:45 and I am betting it will be later than that. Fly Southwest - they are the best when it comes to making changes to your flight. They are very accommodating easy to deal with and generally care about their passengers. I will not fly Delta again.",,Business,Economy Class,Detroit to Tampa,July 2018,4,4,3,4,1,2,no

On my recent trip from Peoria, IL to Bozeman, MT, along with my two adult daughters and a niece, the young man pushing my wheelchair at the Minneapolis airport was very helpful in getting us to the departure gate on time. On our return trip, the plane was very late leaving Bozeman for Minneapolis. We only had 10 minutes from deplaning time to our departure to Peoria. That young man, pushing my wheelchair, was also very helpful. When we exited the tram from Section D to Section A, we heard our names called for the flight. We were at A 1 and going to A 13. My 53 year old daughter said, should I run and the young man said Yes. She started running and then my 61 year old daughter started running and passed her sister. They were waiting for our group when she arrived at the departure gate because they could see the ""girls"" running toward them.

Basically it took Delta 3 weeks to find and deliver my bags. To add insult to injury, Delta decided to compensate me with $100, and even that, it's a voucher I have to use towards my next ticket purchase with Delta.

We were never made aware of a $150 unaccompanied minor fee. Her flight was cancelled due to poor weather. I get that. It happens but the customer service that followed is unacceptable. Gate agent told my 16 year old daughter that since the fee was not paid there was nothing she could do. My wife had to speak to gate agent on speaker phone to even get her to do basic customer service. The lack of compassion this gate agent showed is appalling. Regardless of any additional fees paid or not the safety of a minor should have been Delta Airlines main priority. Leaving a minor stranded without rectifying the issue is unacceptable. It should not have taken a call from an adult to fix. She knows her job she chose to be lazy and do the bare minimum or actually even less than that. With all the bad press Delta has been receiving you would think that retraining your agents would be a priority.

We consider ourselves to be consistent flyers of Delta (4 flights a year) and seem to be considered part of the “lower class” in their terms. Being forced to fly in zone 4 everytime has began to reveal the garbage service of Delta. Using zone 4 we NEVER get to bring out bags on board and always have them checked in. Zone 4 also NEVER gets to choose where we sit and get our entire family split and stick in the middle seat all through the plane. Our trip from Washington DC to Detroit was a short bearable trip as it was an hour but this past trip was horrible as having my children with randoms spread across the plane is a horrible way to treat a family. Upon calling to fix our seating the situation got worse, the computer system told us they would call us back in 3 hours . This is ridiculous customer service. They finally called back and told us we could switch with other passengers but NO ONE wants to switch seats to sit in the middle and we were stuck in our horrible seats.

The seating in economy class was in a 2-4-2 configuration and I had an aisle seat in the two seat block. The leg space was sufficient. A personal IFE provided opportunities to view movies and tv shows, listen to music, and track the flight. Controls were easy to use. Earphones were provided. Selection was on the small side but was sufficient. A menu flier was provided - I chose a vegetarian pasta dish, it came with the usual accompaniments of salad, bread, and dessert. Beer and wine were complimentary. A light morning pre-arrival snack was served. The flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Luggage space overhead was ample. A sleep mask, pillow, and blanket came with the seat. The aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth. At check in at JFK's Delta terminal 4, I printed out my boarding pass from a machine and did not have to interact with an agent at a desk. The organization of boarding was more or less smooth with gate agents making announcements and screens displaying boarding status. There was no anxiety or stress at the gate. Nothing to complain about. Delta did its job - taking a customer to his destination on time and in comfort.

The flight had a maintenance issue, which in itself is completely understandable and that I was ok with. Our flight was from San Diego @ 5:25 pm with a layover in LA for 1.5 hours to Vancouver. We were told the flight had been delayed for 10 mins. Come back the flight is delayed for another 10 mins. Come back again and the lady said if it is anywhere past 6:20 we have to come to the front to change our flights as we would miss our connecting. Again totally fine, I am in a line up with one person in front of me awaiting the new update (currently states 6:20 departure) - flights delayed until 8:45pm - again totally fine. Then things start going south. The line was told if we wanted faster service to take a red card and call the number to change flights so I take a card and step out of line as I had to meet my boyfriend to let him know what was happening. I call the airline and there isn't a single flight that night until the next day. Ok that sucks but fine... we both have to book off work the next day now and so I asked politely if there was anything that they could do to make the situation better (aka seat upgrade). Nope notta. Fine. Well can I continue booking my hotel then as I would hope you cover that. Sorry mam, but you have to go to the ladies at the gate to book a room - so now I have to go back to the same line I was encouraged to step out, again 1 person in front of me before. 1 and 1/2 hours later (4 hours since arriving at the airport) finally get to the front- again. I explain to the same lady who told me to step out of the line what happened and again politely asked for anything to make the situation better - again nothing. Standard hotel room and food vouchers which are only good at the airport which we cant use for the meal we already ate while waiting for the delays. Then on our first flight they didn't seat us together and on the second connecting flight (2.5 hours) there were no TV's . This was pretty ridiculous there was zero customer service in handling the situation. We had to take another vacation day which we couldn't even take advantage of because anything worth going to in San Diego takes a full day. At the end of all of it they couldn't at least put us in Premium economy or give us credit we could use for something outside of spending more time at the airport or upgrade our room. I strongly suggest not taking this airline. Cancellations don't happen often but I would rather be stuck with an airline that cares about their customer experience rather than one which is just trying to fill seats.

When I got to the restroom, one flight attendant told me to sit down, and as soon as she said that an announcement came on so I paused to listen. While I was trying to listen, both flight attendants began yelling at me to sit down so I could not hear the announcement and I was already shaking from my anxiety attack. I went to sit down, the seatbelt sign went off, and I walked back to the restroom. I was so nervous that the flight attendants would yell at me again that I waited for them to tell me it was okay to use the restroom.

Delta Air Lines,2,Michael Crimi,11th June 2018,"Not Verified | I wanted to alert fellow fliers that Delta Comfort Plus is really a scam, at least on this flight from New York to Barcelona. This is not premium economy at all. All it is seats with 3 inches more pitch. You get the same long boarding line as economy, same cabin, same seats, same meals, everything the same except a little more legroom. On top of that, a boarding system that was laughable and bad food (I mean inedible). This, for an extra $1000 per person, was insane. On the other hand, flight crew on both flights were excellent, as was the selection of movies on the in flight entertainment system.

Delta Air Lines,1,Wahid Kouider,11th June 2018,"Not Verified | This flight was delayed by one hour or so, which made me miss subsequent flights Delta 0121 (MSP to HND) and China Eastern 0540 (HND to PVG). This delay caused me to change my subsequent flight to next day which caused a penalty of $1,187.90 that I had to pay to China Eastern. Also, when Delta booked me for the next day flight, they told me that my single piece of luggage will be in the same flight as me and that I should not be worried about it. Next day I came early to the airport and wanted to double check that my luggage is on-boarded with me in the same flight, to my surprise, I figured out that my piece of luggage was actually sent to Chicago and no one can explain why? I spent an hour with luggage service, at the end they told me that we are forwarding it to Shanghai and that it will be in Shanghai 8 hours before me, so, I was OK to just go to luggage service to pick it up once there. When I reached Shanghai, the luggage service could not even track it, China Eastern had no clue where it is. Next day I spend couple hours on the phone to try to figure out when can I receive my luggage but didnt get anything. I called then Delta luggage service, they told me that my luggage is still in Chicago and it is planned to go to HND next day then to PVG. After calling 2 to 3 times a day, finally I received my luggage 4 days since my original flight. I was on a business trip and my stop at Shanghai was primary for meetings scheduled for Saturday April 28th, due to delay, I missed these meeting and my stop at Shanghai become worthless. I couldnt make up for these meetings since Monday and Tuesday was a Holiday in China and I had to continue my trip to my next stop in Wuhan. The damage caused by this delayed flight and luggage is difficult to quantify beside the cash penalty that I paid ($1,187.90).

Our flight was delayed multiple times making a 3 hour delay and would result in missing our connecting flight into Seattle to make it to Kauai. There were no later flights this same day to Kauai, so we were scheduled for the next morning to fly from Medford to Seattle (now we’ve missed our first night of vacation). After asking the airline how often this happens, she responded maybe 1/15 planes are delayed and was unlikely it would happen again. Then our next morning flight scheduled for 5.45am and was for the second time, delayed 3 hours to 8.30am and we were scheduled to miss our connecting flight in Seattle once again! Although Delta re-imbursed tickets and we will still make it to Kauai this evening through yet a third scheduling conflict - it has put us behind 24 hours into our trip.

For the first time we decided to try first class. Now, the flight out was much better than the return which is what I am rating here. Note above my indication of how far out we booked. So, we checked in online and confirmed our return flight. We went to the airport and got our boarding passes (should have looked at them at the desk) but when we went to board were told we were in zone 2. Indeed the passes showed seats 24A and B. Went to counter to see what was the reason. Never got a clear reason. Change of plane (was same model as indicated on travel plans) a passenger being moved over (shouldn't we have been given priority?) and some other reason I cannot really recall right now. Let me also point out that our baggage was checked as if we were still first class which would seem odd if we were bumped to economy. Now, they told us we will receive vouchers because of this event (first class) and some refund. We are still awaiting an answer on that and our travel agent is helping. Then, oddly, just before we boarded, a seat opened up in first class. (No, we did not take it as we wanted to sit together) Delta, your service is extremely lacking.

We boarded the plane, as normal, and then waited. For more than two hours. No acknowledgement was made by Delta that this flight would be late; instead, they kept stating that it would only be another ""10 minutes"" before we could take off. Ten minutes turned into changing the route, having to add fuel (a 45 minute venture) and adding half an hour to the new flight time. Don't fly with Delta. Instead of taking ownership over their mistakes (like not marking the flight as delayed or boarding us despite bad weather) they will instead treat their passengers horribly when they try to figure out what is going on and respond rudely when the passengers question when they will be leaving.

By the time I called I checked the current price and it was $30 less than my original ticket and $80 less than my mom’s ticket. When I called to request a price adjustment the lady refused. I think that is a horrible business practice. Southwest would credit me in a minute no questions asked. Instead this lady tries comparing my purchase to buying a pair of jeans at final sale?! It’s not a pair of jeans, it’s a flight that hasn’t even been taken yet! I think it’s disgusting to do that and will never fly Delta again as a result!

The next flight out was the next morning, we had to get a hotel which was fine, our luggage was no where to be found. We asked for the luggage to be pulled we waited an hour and a half, and found one of our bags out of four. The issue I had was no one was watching the pulled bag area. My brother who’s bag was pulled was sitting in the middle of the terminal unattended. We walked over to the bag and sure enough it was his.

The plane was new, the interior and seats nicely appointed, food passable and IFE was excellent. Although the movie selection wasn't great, live TV (including sports) made up for this.

Delta booked me a hotel at LA in order to get the next flight to Sydney which was planned for next day at 22:30. The problem is that I had to check out from the hotel at 12:00, which means that I had to wait at the airport for 10:30 hours. Delta also gave me one coupon to have lunch (one meal in 24 hours, thanks Delta for keeping me slim). The best part of the story, however, is that I got a seat next to a giant guy so I had to sit in half seat during my flight.

I received an email shortly thereafter that the flight was delayed, and that I may not make my connector flight. Once again, I called a rep who verified such, and she booked me on a flight going out the next day, the same trip I had originally booked, only one day later.

We travel extensively and I submit reviews whenever possible for all types of service, whether for good or bad but with honestly. Flying out of Minneapolis on Delta we sat on the tarmac for over and hour because of mechanical/electrical issues. Even tho the issue was not fixed, de-icing proceeded and we left for take off. Our connecting flight was in LA where we actually made it to the gate with well over 45 minutes before the boarding process. Our bags however, did not make that connection which we discovered upon arrival in Papeete. Took 3 days for Air France to deliver our stuff to Bora Bora. I realize these things happen and feel that Air France was at fault. The issue was ""what airline do I file a reimbursement for necessities""? Air France strung me along for 4 weeks before I finally found someone who indicated Delta would be the one to reimburse. The whole Air France filing process is a joke. So today I received my $194 check from Delta and am extremely happy that I could actually get some compensation.

When you find a deal on say, Expedia, for any Delta flights, before proceeding with your booking, call Delta with the details of that particular flight, ask them to match the price and ensure that the skymiles are added to your account. It seems like the Customer service department is very poorly trained and therefore every representative gives you different information. My message to Delta Airlines is, kindly train your staff well so they know what the heck is going on.

I fly them almost exclusively and have seen their service continue to decline. On this trip outbound from JFK surprising I did not get my upgrade. First problem the cabin interior was old and stodgy. The entertainment system needed to be rebooted twice and the GOGO WiFi was a NOGO. Worst of all my seat did not recline. Lovely for a transcon flight. On my return I got my upgrade but shockingly the tray table in my premium economy seat was broken. I had to eat from my lap. In all my travels never had a tray table been broken in an upgrade section of a plane. Especially on an important business route.

Delta Air Lines,1,Doug Horrigan,6th May 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Costa Rica via Atlanta. When I booked tickets on the Delta website earlier this year to fly from London to Costa Rica I got all the way to the final screen without any problems only to find that when I clicked 'Buy' a pop up screen appeared telling me that there was now a high demand for these seats and if I wanted them I'd have to pay a couple of hundred dollars more. Delta might find this to be a great way to screw extra money out of your customers (and after all, they are an American company) and it might even be legal; but it's dishonest, unethical and just plain wrong. I've never known this from any other airline in over 40 years of flying. Secondly, as we flew over the Atlantic my wife and I were on the extreme right hand side of the plane, the guy on the same row in seat A had his window open - everyone else had their windows closed as the sun was low and very bright. This caused everyone in the row to have very bright sunlight in their eyes, we all complained to the stewardess who told us that the guy needed to work on his computer and so needed the window open to see the keyboard, I have to note that the window was partially closed so there was no sunlight in his eyes, just everyone elses. No matter how many times we complained the stewardess refused to tell the guy to close the window, so this went on for several hours, it made it difficult to see the entertainment, it made it impossible to sleep and it made the whole experience very unpleasant. Given the way several US airlines have treated their passengers over the past year I doubt that I'll ever fly on an American carrier again, they obviously don't care about passengers. As a further point, Atlanta airport is the biggest dump I've ever had to spend any time in, I'll avoid it like the plague in future",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Costa Rica via Atlanta,March 2018,1,1,2,4,1,1,no

Delta Air Lines,2,Lubov Rom,19th April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Portland to Paris via Seattle with Delta Air Lines. Me and my husband booked our flights from Tel Aviv to Portland and vice versa via CheapOair, flying with KLM, Delta and Air France. The departing flights with a layover in Amsterdam ( with KLM) were great, however the returning flights operated by Delta and Air France were an horrendous experience! It began 2 days before our departure. We received an email notification that our returning flights have been rescheduled. We were not satisfied with the change, and spent more than an hour on an international call with cheapOair customer service to make sure we will depart at the original time and will remain seated together. While booking we paid to CheapOair to ensure we will be seated together, and they ensured us that even though the assigned seats may change, we will be together. In the updated itinerary all seemed OK, and we left for our trip thinking it is. When we checked in to our departing flights the evening before (3 flights with layovers in Seattle and Paris) we were shocked to see we were seated separately in all of them! Air France from Paris to Tel Aviv was the worst, with me being seated in the first rows and my husband in the back. What was even worse is we saw on one of the flights there was a free seat next to my husband, but to choose it meant to pay 60$ extra. Why would they separate us in the first place when there were seats available? Were we suppose to pay for something we already paid for?! We tried to call to Delta customer service, only to wait for more than 2 hours. Left our local sim number and they called back after 3 hours, said they transfer me to international flights customers service, and this time had to wait for another half an hour, left my number and they never called back. Our layovers were very short and we were nervous we won't be able talk with Delta representatives in the airports on time When we got to the airport at Portland, there were no Delta representatives to talk to. Next to the gate however were phones direct to customer service, on which luckily there wasn't any wait time, but the representative wasn't very helpful. When she was told all that we've been through she was silent and couldn't help us reassign the seats. She sent us to the gate to try and fix that. At the gate, representative got us new seats together on our flights from USA to Paris in a few moments. When asked what was the problem to do so from the beginning, she blamed it on Air France in Paris rescheduling one of the original flights and said it also caused the mess with the seats. She also couldn't reassign our seats from Paris to Tel Aviv. When boarded on the plane to Paris, we had a delay of a half an hour because safety buckles were missing and waited for the crew to bring it. After a long wait, apparently they brought the wrong buckles and had to return with the right once. We were afraid we were going to miss our next flight. The flight to Tel Aviv was not any better. Once again, there were seats together we were reassigned to without any problem, and yet again there was a delay of half an hour after boarding because the water system of the plane needed to be checked. Lucky we didn't miss our flights and got home safely! What bothered us the most, however, is that changing our seats seemed like a deliberate move to try make us pay more. Obviously there's no respect for customers.

The line to get the vouchers had several hundred people in it because Delta had screwed up other flights that night and stretched practically outside the bldg. it took several hours to get through the line (because Delta only had 3 people working the desk) which meant that by the time most passengers got the vouchers it was too late to go to the hotel. In addition, we were told that we could get a later flight but needed to call Delta. When we did, we were told hold times were over 2 hours! The vast majority of passengers ended up having to sleep in the airport. Total incompetence by Delta in every way. The few staff that were on hand were impatient and rude.

Delta Air Lines,2,J Manten,16th April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Rome to San Francisco via Atlanta. Terrible experience! They used a 767 for a 11-hour international flight, the plane was very dirty and run-down. The touch screen on the entertainment TV barely worked. The volume was also way too quiet and I could barely hear my movie over people coughing loudly. The second segment from ATL to SFO was much worse despite being only half as long. Boarding took forever and I got stuck sitting next to a man with a nasty cold. His constant loud coughing/sneezing/grunting made it impossible for me to sleep on the near-red eye flight. When we landed it took 30 minutes before we went up to the gate. For some reason that always happens every time I fly Delta. Anyway, baggage claim also took longer than usual because an announcement said the cargo door was having difficulty opening properly and because the carousel wasn't decided until the last second. I'm never flying Delta again unless they upgrade their aircraft and stop overestimating the arrival times. My flight to SFO was estimated to be 6 hours, so the ground staff at the destination prepared for that duration. But since the actual flight time was only 5 hours, we had to wait longer to go up to the gate. By the way, the 737 used for the second flight segment was much more cramped than the ones used by United, and I flew first class.",Boeing 767-400 / 737-900,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Rome to San Francisco via Atlanta,January 2018,1,2,3,1,1,2,no
Delta Air Lines,3,J Mallin,14th April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Boston. I used my company’s travel agency to switch my flight back to Boston to the red eye. I didn’t realize that the agency booked me in the row in front of the emergency exit, meaning the seats in that row don’t recline and it would require me trying to sleep while sitting at a 90 degree angle. There were many open seats after takeoff so I moved to the row in front of me. There was one man in that row in the aisle seat, and his wife was adjacent in another empty row. He very reluctantly allowed me to pass him to sit in the window seat of his row after I explained I wanted to sleep before returning to work in Boston the next morning. Not 20 minutes after I had fallen asleep, the Emporer of aisle 15 had gotten the flight attendant to ask me to evacuate “his” row. The attendant said that I was sitting in an economy plus row. No problem; I did not pay for an economy plus ticket and was more than happy to move to any other row with a reclining chair. I asked her to please tell me where I can move to another open seat. “Sure”, she says, and walks away. I gather my belonging and she comes back to say rudely “You have to move”. I asked if she knew which seat I could move to, and she said there should be some in the back. Super helpful. The only open economy seat was at the very back row which also didn’t recline.",,Business,Economy Class,Seattle to Boston,April 2018,1,1,,,2,3,no

The last flight I was on was delayed for two hours while we were sitting on the runway and the captain of the flight didn’t even tell us what was going on. The flight leaving to Minneapolis from Anchorage was delayed by almost 6 hours! Seriously, they have a record of being the most delayed, slow and honestly the worst communication to their passengers.

First, I did not see the difference with the economy until I noticed a little red strip on the seats. When asked, they are said to have more space between rows. Not very visible. Especially since you are in the same cabin, same food. By the way, now access to priority lane or else. Just a boarding before economy. I fail to see the advantage. Due to poor choice, crazy price, and a time constraint I had no choice but to take this airline and premium eco. I ll avoid this airline like the plague. One last thing.

Delta however charges a $75 dollar standby fee per ticket to be bumped up to the earlier flight. Thats more than the cost of the original tickets. For a family of 4 thats an additional $300.

On the way back the flight attendants were more helpful but when I arrived into LAX there was a flight leaving for SFO shortly so I asked if I could take the earlier flight so as to avoid waiting 2 hours in an overcrowded waiting room that did not have enough seats. I was told there was room and I could get on the earlier flight. Then my name was looked up and they told me that since I had an economy ticket I could not change anything and could not get on the earlier flight.

Delta Air Lines,2,R Lewis,10th April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Airlines like Delta don't actually care about their customers. The lower level staff members generally do, but the company itself and higher ups (aka policy makers) clearly don't. The customer support team and staff agents are virtually powerless and can't really help customers when it matters. Policies are in place to prevent the customer support team from helping the customers by doing simple things like waiving fees or making flight changes easier. The only thing it seems like staff members have the authority to do is provide customers with an extra set of Biscoffs during in-flight service. It's unfortunate because I used to love Delta but now feel a strong sense of distrust and dissatisfaction with the brand. I don't matter to Delta and neither does my brand loyalty. The employees seemingly aren't allowed to make any changes that aid customers unless they charge them an arm and a leg first due to the company policies. Delta customer support doesn't actually help customers without charging them fees for ridiculous things like flight change despite already having forced customers to pay upwards for $25 dollars extra.",,Business,Premium Economy,Boston to Columbus,April 2018,3,4,3,2,3,1,no

At this point we are 4 hours out from our original departure time. Right as boarding was supposed to begin another hour was added to the delay. This is my first time flying alone. I am 18, unfamiliar with this airport. The pilot told us they checked the circuit at 7.10, when they realized there was an issue, 5 minutes before we were supposed to leave! Why wasn’t this examined prior to boarding an entire plane of people? This is unprofessional and inconsiderate of customers time and money.

The seats in economy were cramped just like every other airlines. As soon as they turned on the AC, air inside started smelling gas. That alone made me feel like running out of the plane.

They nickle and dime you for everything and even have a scam to try and get people to pay extra for seats they could have for free. They have a ridiculous charge of $75 if you wish to switch to an earlier flight, which is crazy considering the fact that the seats are already available.

The hotel will not even come up as an option on the Delta Vacations website if you put that # of people in one room. The hotel supervisor said that she had not seen this happen in her 15 years working there. It is against hotel policy to book more than 4 to a room.

Delta Air Lines,3,C Leane,9th March 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Atlanta to Amsterdam. Now I know why the ticket was so cheap. I'll avoid using Delta in future. I knew that US carriers have a bad reputation for quality and service, so I gave them a chance (also other carriers, not just Delta) because of the low price. However, I'll definitely stick with European, Asian or Middle Eastern carriers in future. The cabin crew were friendlier and more courteous to each other than they were to passengers. When serving food and drink they would have thrown the items at passengers if they could. Service felt rushed and items were dropped onto tray tables, not placed. When serving from the drinks cart, some flight attendants maintained a conversation with each other and didn't even look at passengers when serving - they just looked straight ahead at each other, with their arm held out to the side, waiting for passengers to take the plastic cup from them. That kind of body language is a display of contempt and disdain. Some were more polite than others, but none were in the same league as flight attendants from Asian or Middle Eastern carriers. Unfriendly cabin crew are a common feature among US airline companies. Their boarding process is inefficient. They board by zone number (which is printed on your boarding pass). Your zone is related to how much you paid for your ticket, not the section of the aircraft you're seated in (as it's done on better quality airlines). It would make much more sense to board by row number, starting at the rear to prevent blocking the aisles, as this would reduce waiting times.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Amsterdam,March 2018,2,1,2,3,2,3,no

Staff stated multiple times that there was “no need to stand in line if you have questions about the flight as I won’t be open to questions about this flight for another 10 minutes”. The flight she was talking about was headed to Florida and was not my flight. I continued to wait patiently as she continued to repeat her statement about not waiting in line for questions. Finally I said to her that I had a question about the next flight out, not the current one. To which she replied, well I don’t know anything about that flight. My response was to ask her if she knew anything about the gate check in seating and how that works as I’ve never encountered that before. And her response was beyond dismissive and rude. She waved her hands on the air saying “how would I know anything about that, just go to customer service” as she walked away from the gate with a line of at least 4 customers behind me. She is an extremely poor representation of Delta and, in my humble opinion, should not be working anywhere with people or customer service.

When I followed up the next morning their helpline informed me that a request for an additional flight was never even submitted.

Delta was beyond belief this past weekend. I was already annoyed that I had a connecting flight, so I booked an early in order to make an appointment in San Diego, CA. My outbound flight to MSP was delayed so much that I missed the connecting flight to SAN. Once I arrived in MSP, I was directed to the service desk for assistance. The Service Desk agent displayed absolutely no empathy and told me my next flight out was going to be with an additional connection through LAX. So I was originally going to get to SAN around 1pm. Now with the delays and re-route this was going to push me back to 9pm. I asked at the service desk if they compensate their customers in any way and she said ""Well, if you were here more than 8 hours we would give you a meal voucher and Delta feels if they get you there within 24 hours then that is the best they can do."" Her words, not mine. I was floored. So I asked her to terminate my trip in LAX and I would get my own transportation from there to SAN instead of sitting in the airport another two hours. I get to LAX and no bag! I ran like a mad woman to baggage services so that they could keep my bag from going on the connecting flight to SAN. The agent there was emotionless as he put a note in the computer and he told me to wait 20 minutes until they respond. I said ""Uhm, can you call them please? I would like to get my bag and leave."" He said ""ok."" I mean why do I have to instruct you on how to extend good customer service? He called and my bag was produced within the next few minutes. I tried to purchase a ticket on another carrier for my return flight home in a couple of days, but they were just too expensive. But I can guarantee, I will not fly Delta ever again after this.

My flight into SLC was delayed just long enough to miss my connection to my home town, for the fourth time in a row. As usual, the only options Delta suggested required me to pay out of pocket, for a hotel or rental car. Somehow, no matter what the cause of my missed flight is, they have exempted themselves from offering any sort of compensation (“Oh, we can’t do anything about that.”) This time they did change my flight to a nearby city, but with no way of making it home from there. It kind of seems like an attempt to look like they are trying to help while actually being the opposite of helpful, unless stranding me with no way home is considered helpful. Unfortunately, my employer books exclusively through Delta, so I will likely go through this again. SLC plays loud piano music all night, with regular security announcements.

Delta Air Lines,1,Terrill Dobson,23rd January 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | We flew over for my Mother's 85th birthday and though we'd try Delta as they fly directly from the UK to the States. We paid higher than the ""going rate"" for our flight especially because we wanted a smooth overnight return so that we could return to work the day after return. The flight over was very good, we were impressed. But, our connection from Richmond to our NY overseas flight was suddenly cancelled. The ground crew hardly knew how to cope with such. They claimed it much be weather, though had no idea. As their flights to other NY airports were flying, and the weather report looked fine this could not be the case. After much back and forth we were routed through Atlanta (still suffering from the hurricanes) and then Amsterdam. This was the longest return we'd ever experienced in our 30 years of regular travel between the UK/US. Needless to say we could not return to work the following day as planned. So initially we were very disappointed at how poorly Delta handled our return. We can only assume that the flight was cancelled because they hadn't the numbers, and thus the profit. This was the first clue of a problem. The confused and almost useless ground staff the second clue. Note that we had to work with them for a realistic return as their initial proposal did not allow adequate lay-over time in Atlanta given the airport size. Then on return I wrote a complaint to Delta. Next clue was that complaints are automated through a soulless computer process. Then I was warned that they were experiencing a high volume to customer service requests and while they hoped to answer in 30 days they could not promise. 30+ days, seriously? Well they passed our complaint, about Delta's handling of our custom, over the KLM who few the transatlantic flight. They must never had even read the complaint. Since then we've had two emails from KLM about how they are too busy to reply but will soon. So now it is almost 4 months after a complaint and nothing. Just so disappointing.

Three entree options were provided and were accompanied by an appetizer, a salad, a soup, and some deserts afterwards. Delta uses Westin's Heavenly bedding onboard all of their Delta One flights which was very comfortable.

Then Delta had a scheduled flight change and the arrival time in SEA got changed to 10:20am. I had an important meeting to attend at noon on 01/08 so I requested Delta to put me on a flight on 01/07 night instead which they did. My new flight was from RDU to SEA via ATL with a stopover of 45 minutes. The flight from RDU to ATL got delayed by 15 minutes. The RDU ATL flight arrived at gate B18 and the ATL SEA flight was from gate E6. Why would they even suggest such an itinerary with 45 minutes of stopover. I ran my heart out and reached gate E6 10 minutes before departure but the door had already closed. There were plenty of other passengers with me. Could they not have waited for 10 more minutes? Was it so difficult to see that there are other people connecting to this flight who had landed just 10 minutes before, more so given the fact that the flight was the last flight for the night to SEA from ATL? After that, I got rebooked on a flight to SEA via SLC reaching SEA at 12:30pm on 01/08. So basically the reason why I prepone my flight to 01/07 in order to reach on time for my meeting, you are now taking me to SEA even after my original direct flight from RDU to SEA. I told the gate agent about that and she was outright rude. I said I have to attend the meeting and I will take a non delta flight and reach SEA on time for my meeting. She told me that I wont get any refund since I am already rebooked on a different flight. So basically I ended up spending the whole night in ATL, waiting 4 hours in the terminal to get my bag out, and then ended up taking a 6:15am Alaska flight to SEA.

After arriving at San Diego International Airport at 430am for my 7am departure our flight was delayed over and hour. This delay was not due to weather. We landed at JFK Airport and we waited well over a half hour to even get off to a gate to de-board. This caused me to miss my layover to Syracuse, NY.

Yes, I'm frustrated but also upset due to the inconsistency of the airline - why couldn't my Delta connection wait for all the passengers from JFK to Syracuse instead of leaving right at that moment.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Syracuse,December 2017,3,3,3,3,2,2,no
Delta Air Lines,1,J Kiratiburana,8th January 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | New York to London. Got here at 5pm for our 8pm flight yesterday, endured 5hrs of gate changing and ridiculous excuses and lies. No available gate, waiting for Egyptair to finish. Prepping said plane, then more gate hopping for several hours. Back to waiting for Egyptair to get off. Waiting for cabin crew to prep - no cabin crew as they’ve finished their shift and we have to wait for the next cabin crew at unknown time of arrival Boarded a few people, then made them come off the plane as it was “too cold” as the engine had no fuel! Pilot didn’t even know how long it’d take. We have all collectively concluded that none of this was true and later found out that flights to London never take off from the gates we were made to hopscotch between. Then on the 7th hour at 2am we were told that the next flight was at 6:30PM. Queued for 3hrs just to ask a question which took us to 5am. With 13hrs wait time ahead of us, we were unable to leave and with zero facilities here, no shops open, no hotel rooms nearby, rude useless staff who kicked sleeping mothers and children out of airline lounges. Overheated space with nowhere to sit, no water offered and no care to those with young children. I saw so many dismissed and sent away from the airport without any care. Absolutely disgusted by all this. Only this morning they took the initiative to give out some drinks and muffins to those with newly delayed flights. Clearly the media’s hitting hard but what about the rest of us who endured 12hrs last night, held hostage and treated like cattle in dirt with no food or bedding? Utterly disgusting and to top it all off, my sister just asked for a pillow from a Delta employee and her rude response was “I was handing them out at 2 last night, they’re all gone, what do you want me to do about it?” No care, no kindness, no sympathy - just a mockery of what we’re having to go through.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to London,January 2018,1,1,,1,1,1,no

Delta Air Lines,1,R Heaton,4th January 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Savannah. Delta has no sense of customer service at all. I purchased 5 first class tickets from Georgia to Colorado with a connection in Atlanta. Circumstances led my sister to need to fly out of Atlanta and return in Atlanta. (We knew we were losing the extra money for her Savannah flights but she was keeping her same seat on her Atlanta flights) I waited on hold for three hours to let Delta know she will no longer need the flights I paid for from Savannah to Atlanta and from Atlanta to Savannah. I was then informed it would cost an additional $448 to allow her to check in in Atlanta. As a result, she drove 3.5 hours to Savannah to make the Savannah flight. The day before the flight, I tried to check all of us in; however, my sister was no longer on the itinerary anywhere. So i waited an additional 1.5 hours to see why she was no longer on the itinerary. Turns out the delta rep who tried to change her flight information gave her a different itinerary number. To compensate, Delta gave us a $100 voucher to use to purchase any delta tickets. On the flight home she did not board as she needed to stay in Atlanta. So I allowed my nephew to sit in her seat that I already paid for. Deltas employees then made him get up and go to his assigned seat in the main cabin so one of their pilots could sit in the first class seat I paid for! Very unfortunate that Deltas employees choose to make sure they are comfortable rather than the paying customers. Extremely disappointed in this airline. I will not be recommending this airline and will try to avoid using Delta for future flights.",,Family Leisure,First Class,Atlanta to Savannah,January 2018,4,1,3,3,3,1,no

Each flight they didn't tell me the 3rd time it got delayed, I found out at the airport. The first flight they didn't say anything at all at the counter I had to find it on a TV after we hadn't started boarding when we were supposed to, customer service is rude, they don't care about their customers, the boarding agents are angry and aggressive.

I called WestJet, on hold etc back and forth with them, to make a long story short they told me I must re-book with Delta who again (different person) they cannot help me and I must call WestJet. Out of frustration I left the airport since I wasn't getting anywhere and it had been 2 hours of trying to book another flight.

It was unclear what we were supposed to do and we waited for a long time before realising that we were supposed to use the e-kiosk for check in. Boarding was also an absolute mess with no clear line or anything. It took ages to board as people were blocking the aisles.

Process of rescheduling was somewhat stressful. Westjet and Delta staff were helpful but their systems do not interact well. Worked with Westjet gate attendant then followed that with calls to Delta, Westjet and finally Delta again to sort out a flight change for the next day for a Bangor to RDU routing. Flight out of Bangor was delayed. Gate agent at Bangor was greeting passengers as they reached the gate area, offering snacks, pre-checking bags, thanking everyone for flying Delta. He was also proactive in assisting those who needed help with wheelchairs or pre-boarding. Flight BGR-LGA was okay - crew efficient and professional. Connection in LGA went okay, flight to RDU boarded a bit early but pilot came on the PA and sounded very frustrated as he advised us of a last minute route change from Air Traffic Control. This caused a slight delay in take off. Flight was okay as well though very unusual - we flew very low (about 5,000 feet according to Flight Tracker) for most of the route. This made the trip a bit longer than scheduled but the pilot kept us informed so not a big issue. Flight attendants also efficient and professional.

We really didn't like that we were not able to choose our seats. We had to check in at the airport, using a machine, which allocated our seats. As we were right at the back of the plane, we were not particularly surprised to find that there was no choice left for us when the first meal was served. However, when it happened again on the second meal, I have to say that I was pretty annoyed. They had also completely run out of the icecream and there was no excuse for just not having enough of something that was not a choice. I cannot understand why, having disappointed us the first meal, they could not have served us first on the second meal, the kitchen was directly behind us and they had to pass us to start serving from the front again. We ended up having nothing at all to eat and my husband was ravenous.

Delta has failed to get me to my destination in a comfortable and timely fashion every time I have flown with them. The most recent fiasco was my flight from Charlotte to Albuquerque. Less than an hour after taking off, the captain comes over the speaker to tell us that the cabin pressure system had malfunctioned and to remain safe we had to stay at 10k feet and divert to Cincinnati. We were informed that we all had to deplane and was told it would be a few minutes. After a half hour of no information, I finally talked to the customer service. They informed me that it was going to be another hour. The hour passes then it's two hours. Then three. I talk to customer service to see what I could do about missing my connection. I was given 3 options; have a six and a half layover to wait for the next plane, fly back to Charlotte and try again in three days, or give up and get a flight on a more reliable airline. On top of this awful situation, in the past I have been snapped at by customer service, delayed four and a half hours because a kid puked in the aisle, ignored by chatting FA, and left stranded in another country for 18 hours.

About 3 hours before the flight got notified of a 35 minute delay. Once at the gate, the flight got pushed out by another hour and eventually we were moved to another gate for departure. Boarding was delayed yet another 30 minutes but was conducted by zone and in an orderly manner. Onboard the seat was comfortable and having purchased an exit row seat, I had ample leg room. The service was prompt and we were offered drinks and a choice of 4 snacks. The FA were efficient but lacked warmth. The flight eventually departed with a 3 hour delay and was late arriving after in Tampa.

Delta Air Lines,1,C Darinu,26th December 2017,"✅ Trip Verified | Portland to Salt Lake City. So, over the night we had 1 inch of snow in Portland and our flight was scheduled for 6:00AM. We get to the airport and see that the check in supposed to start at 5:20AM starts at 5:40AM. We get jn the plane, it was already over 6:00AM and people were still finding their seats. I have to mention that our connecting flight in SLC was 30 minutes away from the PDX flight landing. This combo of flights was offered by the company I did not choose it specifically. Temperature outside was about 40 degrees no snowing, no raining and they had to deice the plane. Only that they started doing it at 6:15AM. Again, Our departure was scheduled at 6:00AM they start deicing at 6:15. Great customer service, especially after we got stuck on the tarmac for another hour so our plane ended up taking off at 7:15AM. We missed the connection in SLC. I go to the counter lady who of course told us that she will rebook us the second day. I said fine, so who is gonna cover our hotel and expenses? She said we do not cover that type of stuff when a delay is because of the weather? And here I give up, when you were already late with the boarding you act incompetent and start to deice the plane with 15 minutes after the departure time, when outside is clear sky and 40 degrees? When I brought up all these arguments to her she did not know what excuse to find and she said that she will not cover our expenses and she is the boss so I cannot talk with anybody else. So after showing a huge level of incompetency to your clients that paid for your tickets, you do not even try to make it up to them?

At 7:30 pm we got a text saying our flight was cancelled, my husbands flight got rebooked to get into Las Vegas late Christmas Eve and my flight wasn’t rebooked to get in Christmas Day. We didn’t panic because we thought we would have enough time to resolve this issue. However we got stuck on hold with Delta for 3.5 hours. By that time we decided this is a joke and if we’re going to beat holiday traffic Christmas Eve we better get going even if that meant we wouldn’t get to our destination until 3:00 am. We were already on vacation so we had to extend our rental another day and pay for gas in an SUV to get to Vegas. By the time we were an hour into our drive delta finally answered only to tell us that our flight was cancelled due to weather and that there was nothing they could do to make this situation right.

The lounge after clearance is far superior to the DATA lounges in both T1 & T2 in Dublin. Boarded the rather ageing aircraft with 40 rather cramped seats.

Champagne was closeted away, the sauce with the chicken was far too salty for my liking. Amenity kit which is touted is very basic does not have a comb, however in its defense it does contain a generic hand sanitizer in gel form however would have been better had this been Purell.

Terrible customer service when they delayed our flight three times and ended up canceling. We were also told that there would be no flights to our destination in the next two days due to it being already full from earlier cancellations. Not to mention, the hotels nearby were already filled with reservation and they provided the least possible amount of customer service in a very rude along with unprofessional manner. Our former flight before our connecting flight was also a disaster to say the least. Never have I ever landed at the destination only to wait an hour just to get off the plane. Why? This was all due to Delta's poor planning of available gates for incoming planes. When we did get to the gate, we had to wait for their crew to actually do their job for once for us to actually enter the airport. That was an additionally ten minute delay.

I have never know so many changes to occur on what appeared to be a frequent basis! My issue however is with seat allocation and the way that Delta change it! On the flight from Orlando to Atlanta (A321) we had selected two rows of three seats one behind the other (the infant was not allocated a seat). Delta split this into 2x2 and 2x1 seats with the four and five year olds being allocated seats on their own. Madness! On the next flight from Atlanta to Amsterdam (A330) we had reserved a block of 4 seats in the central aisle of row 37 with two seats behind in row 38. Delta then changed this to the four in row 37 and two in row 31 so that (in their words) ""we could all be together""! Again the family were split up for no apparent reason!

Delta Air Lines,5,Fernando Valenzuela,14th November 2017,"✅ Verified Review | This was my first time flying with Delta from Atlanta to Houston. I usually fly United. Boarding was at 11:20am. I got there at 11:35am as the security line was pretty long. When I boarded the plane it looked almost full. The only thing I had with me was 1 carry on. I could not find space in the first class section, so I walked down to about the 15th row of seats and could not find a space for it all. I decided to go backup to the front and let the flight attendant know about my situation. The line of the passengers behind me was building up as they were boarding the plane trying to get to their seats while I was trying to get back to the front. The flight attendant saw me and noticed that I was trying to get back up to the front. I was able to tell her my problem, She gave me the most nasty attitude as if it was my fault that there was no more room on the plane for my carry on. I was in shock - a first class customer struggling with my carry on and here she is acting like if it was my fault! This is the last thing I would expect from a flight attendant under the circumstances I was in. Will never fly with Delta again if there is other options available.",,Solo Leisure,First Class,Atlanta to Houston,November 2017,3,1,,,5,3,no
Delta Air Lines,7,J Mackay,10th November 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Flew New York JFK to Philadelphia. This flight did not last a full hour and I must mention that there is a marked difference between the friendliness of the international crew of Delta and the domestic crew of Delta. The domestic crew are far less professional on their behavior and attitude to passengers onboard. My connecting flight from Italy to New York arrived on time however the bags were placed late on the belt and by the time I made it through US customs and walked from gate 14 to 33 because no one in JFK was willing to help I arrived at the plane seconds before they closed the door. Upon entering the aircraft I was surprised because the flight attendant told me to sit in seat 4 D (Business Class) I thought this was due to the delay as a way of saying thank you I quickly found out she made a mistake and in front of everyone asked me to leave the cabin (I was embarrassed to say the least), realizing what she had done she offered me a ""Comfort Seat"", to be honest I did not notice any difference between that seat and a regular seat on coach. I have to say the aircraft looked brand new, clean and before I could buckle my seatbelt we were already in Philadelphia. Delta’s iPhone app is great for tracking your bags and other flight related info. My only observation is the marked difference between the domestic and the international crew. Overall I would fly Delta again, the planes look and feel new, clean, the seats and space are better than their other US competitors. Good job Delta just please could you retrain your domestic crew to be more like your international crew? I’m still a fan regardless of that!",Boeing 757-200,Business,Economy Class,New York JFK to Philadelphia,November 2017,3,2,,,3,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,J Mackay,10th November 2017,"✅ Verified Review | This was my first time flying Delta International from Milan to New York and I have to say I am impressed with their service and the attention to detail provided by the aircrew. I was hoping to get their signature airplane, the new Airbus 350 however the equipment we flew in Airbus 330 was very nice. Upon boarding I asked one of the flight attendants if I could move to an empty row and she was very nice and said to me that I could grab any seat I wished so I went on and sat on an empty row of 2. I have attached multiple pictures to show the menu with the great choices they give you (in coach!), the airplane had Wi-Fi for the entire nine hour flight, however I must mention that the entertainment was not good. The TV shows and the music channels were not working. To be honest that was not a deterrent because I was thrilled with the Wi-Fi and thanks to my T-Mobile plan I had one free hour plus unlimited texting on Messenger and WhatsApp. I usually fly internationally on European or Asian airlines because the service provided by US-based companies is poor however Delta is changing this and they are a strong competitor in this route up to par with European-based airlines, they can’t match the Asian airlines yet but compared to other US companies they provide a superior service and I would fly Delta international again for sure. I must make an observation about Delta’s new ""Comfort Seat"" I’m not sure it’s worth the money because I did not see a difference between that seat and the one I had. I hope they expand to premium economy on more flights. Overall I give Delta two thumbs up!",A330-300,Business,Economy Class,Milan to New York,November 2017,3,4,4,3,4,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,1,E Layton,7th November 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I booked Spokane to San Jose, then San Jose to Spokane. This originally consisted of 4 flights. Spokane to Seattle and Seattle to San Jose and vice versa. Only 1 of those flights actually happened. I was notified and hour before my first flight that it had been cancelled and was only offered a flight leaving in the next 30 minutes or a flight leaving 6 hours later than planned. The flights did not go through Seattle either, they went through Salt Lake City. This wasn’t a huge deal. I got to San Jose a little earlier than planned, but not without the headache. On the way back to Spokane, my flight from San Jose to Seattle went accordingly. However on arrival to SeaTac airport, I was informed of a delay. I was also told that I would be leaving from gate D4. I went to D4 and the screen said Eugene Oregon. So, I updated my email and it said I was actually to leave from S16. I went to gate S16. There was nothing. I asked the concierge desk and they said flight from D4 had left. So I switched to the next flight to Spokane. Which was only a stand-by ticket. I figured since I had an hour, I’d check if D4 had actually left. It had not. They would not switch me back to my original flight from D4.

Delta Air Lines,8,X Wang,6th November 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Los Angeles to New York JFK. A very pleasant experience with Delta, check-in and bag drop at LAX was seamless, despite long lines for the security at terminal 2. However the boarding process was a bit hectic and it feels like Delta is trying to cram as many flights into the small terminal 2 at LAX. Flight services on the cross-continent flight are wonderful. Glad to see they've upgraded the personal entertainment system on the 767s into newer larger HD screens. It's the best flying across the country on a 767 since it's spacious and you don't have to pass 2 people to go out of your seat if you have a window seat. Really surprised that on this flight delta provided complimentary lunch for all classes (even economy!) The beef pastrami sandwich was so good it made into one of the best pastrami I've ever had! Food was well-plated and presented too, with a side salad and desserts. Delta also now provides free wifi for texting and messaging on all flights! This is a game changer!

Delta Air Lines,5,K Sheares,3rd November 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Munich to Tampa via Atlanta. First time I have flown Delta internationally as it is not an airline I typically fly or prefer. But due to an attractive airfare from Germany to Florida in business class I decided to give it a try. I was shocked about the age of the plane and the seating for business class. Both are old and outdated. I read Delta decided to keep its aging aircraft and not turn over for newer aircraft and clearly this route is one of those where the older planes are utilized. Their terminal location at the Munich airport is in keeping with their aircraft, old beat up, primitive and a lot of cattle herding before boarding the aircraft. Once onboard and into my seat I realized the business class seats were really out of date in both design and fittings. The video system failed and was unavailable for the flight which was a real drag for 9.4 hours. The provided headphones were cheap copies of Bose which in other airlines is a standard for business and first class. (Return flight I will be sure to download movies and bring my own headset.) The food service looked good but the chicken meal was so overcooked and the cooked spinach was filled with grit. The light meal served before landing in Atlanta was so salty I could not eat it either. So both meals were inedible and a good thing I had a solid breakfast before boarding the flight. Seat was comfortable but very tight unless one is 150 lbs and under 5'10"". A blanket and good size pillow was provided which helped. Bottled water was provided so one did not have to ring for the flight attendant for something to drink. Because of the configuration of the 767 the bathroom was behind business class and attached next to the food preparation area for coach passengers. This also meant sharing those bathrooms with coach passengers as well. Though I never had to wait for a free bathroom. Again, old plane with a older design compared to the new standards most airlines now have for their bread and butter business class passengers. OK for the much talked about service model that Delta staff employ for its business class passengers is true they do really try hard to be charming and helpful but I suspect it is to cover up all the Delta deficiencies has using these out of date aircraft. But in the end it did not help the fact the food was terrible, the video system did not work and the airport waiting, boarding process was much akin to a SouthWest experience.",Boeing 767-400,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Tampa via Atlanta,October 2017,2,3,1,,3,3,no

I was travelling with my two children and this was worrying. When we went through security we could not scan our boarding passes and were told by security that we were on standby. This was very upsetting, I had booked the tickets months earlier. Finally on the flight, my son, was in the row in front of me, the first statement the steward made was, ""We are very understaffed and I don't know how we'll cope"".

Delta Air Lines,9,Johnny Ninh,27th October 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Seoul to Atlanta via Houston. This was my first time flying Delta and I was impressed. Delta's Comfort + was the most comfortable I've been on in a long time for the price ($1100). That's at least $300 less then other airlines economy class running the Asia route vs Delta's premium Comfort plus. The staff was nice and accommodating, despite there being some confusion with Incheon crew, I think they were in training or new staff cause they seemed a bit nervous so minus a star there. Flight wise, food was above average in taste with 3 selections, not your mom's home cooking but satisfying. Best of all, the free Starbucks and Bailey's on the house and other drink selection was a fantastic touch. Free messaging wifi helped me kept in contact with those below and organize schedules. (Kakao Talk worked, even though it was not on the list of usable apps, so I think any messaging app is ok as long as you don't send pictures or files you're fine.) Delta also gave free face mask, ear plugs and ear phones. Movie infotainment system selection was great. Leg room was ample my knees didn't touch the back on the person in front at all even at front on a full recline, I'm 5'10"". Seats were plush and soft and my the neck rest didn't feel annoying like some airlines that leave you craning. Would definitely fly again in the future.

Delta Air Lines,1,J Chantera,24th October 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Tampa. Anyone below First class and business class were treated as second class citizens. On the return trip we didn't get a seat when we checked in online. It said that the seat would be assigned at the gate. Which gate? I had no idea, because Delta doesn't bother to put it on the ticket. Anyway, a line started to form as the agent got to the gate. She gave the first person in line a seat, the next person a seat and then the third person in line a seat and told the rest of us to sit down unless we were will to give up our reservation for a voucher. She said ""I need to work on the voucher people first"". I was second in line at that point and I asked ""will you at least call the people who were in line first?"" She said she would take my name; I didn't move. The man right offered to take a later flight, but when he was told it was the next day, he sat down. I ended up getting my seat assignments; I presume because she didn't want me to cause anymore trouble. She kept asking for people to take a $600 voucher to give up their paid reservation. Then they start on the carry on luggage threat. ""if you are in zones 2 or 3, there isn't going to be any room to store your carry on. We'll check your bag for free"" I don't want to check my bag, it takes longer to get out of the airport and my husband's bag has been lost several times.

This week we made the mistake of using basic economy which really means only middle seats in the back of the plane. Had we known that we would have picked a different option.

The FA working in my area (seat 1A), as well the purser of the flight was very friendly. The other two FA's in C were very kind as well and we had long conversations. F&B: outstanding.

Planes in decent shape and reasonably clean. Delta had changed my routing after I purchased the tickets which was not an issue for me as the timing was essentially the same. However, they did not send an advisory on this but, fortunately, I double check reservations a couple of time before I travel so I caught the change. I did print out all my copies of the schedule to be on the safe side and this turned out to be useful. When we arrived in Toronto on the return leg, the computer system did not seem to recognize the revised booking. When we could not get our boarding passes and the agent questioned our booking, I had the documentation and, though it took about 15-20 minutes, she finally got us sorted out and printed our boarding passes.

Two of the flight attendants spent time letting every passenger know their connecting gate in Detroit and how to navigate the Airport. This was amazing and appreciated by everyone.

Delta Air Lines,8,Robert Rae,3rd October 2017,✅ Verified Review | Flew Edmonton to San Francisco via Seattle. What a pleasant surprise - a domestic US carrier that is working hard to improve customer service. Check in was efficient and staffed by helpful friendly people. Boarding was equally efficient. The flight attendants worked hard to deliver genuine service and nothing was ever a problem. This was my 5th and 6th flight with Delta Air Lines this year - I have been trying them after consistent issues with AA. Based on this experience I will be using them more often.

Delta Air Lines,2,T Jones,3rd October 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Terrible customer service. Delta allows you to book a flight for a certain day and time and will then change your itinerary by 6hours weeks to months later, with no remediation if their new flight plan for you doesn't work with all the travel plans you've made. Secondly, they routinely check all rollerboards for zone 3 passengers no matter that there are always plenty of overhead spaces. They just don't care that passengers might prefer to keep their possessions with them (which I do, having had checked luggage not arrive with me more times than I can count). Thirdly, seats are very uncomfortable, forcing everyone into a hunched position. One positive is that the last couple planes I've been on have had more leg room and wider aisles than I'm used to. In summary, hate that airlines take advantage of customers. Unfortunately, Delta isn't the only one that does this.",MD90,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Madison to Detroit,October 2017,2,2,,,1,2,no

The price, despite being in summer season, was excellent, especially in comparison to most other options. The level of service was the best we've experienced in many years of travel. It begins with the cockpit crew and attendants greeting passengers on entrance to and departure from the flights. They seemed more personable and enthusiastic than is common, and communicated pride and pleasure in their work. The food was surprisingly good and plentiful, free beverages were varied and frequent. We counted two passes with hot towels and four involving beverages. The entertainment options were fresh and divergent.Finally, we were forced to return due to a member of family's medical emergency.

Having paid a couple more dollars, I was able to secure seats for my family and me. I received a confirmation e-mail and everything looked good. It would've been the perfect vacation / honeymoon for me and my husband who got married a week before. Delta gave me the worst traveling experience ever. I bought a total of 16 tickets in the span of 2 weeks for me and my family. I just want to sit next to my husband. I paid to achieve that. I reserved seats 32A and 32B, but when we went to check in, we got seats 35A and 34B. I paid for a service and didn't get it. I was traveling with my mom and aunt as well as my husband, but because they left half way, I thought I just booked the seats and would've figured out seating arrangements amongst ourselves when we got on the plane.

Waited at the gate kiosk for 15 minutes only to have them rudely direct me to a delta customer service counter. There, I had to wait for almost an hour and once I talked to the lady she said that since I was an economy customer she could not rebook me for another flight since I had a zero balance available.

The service was decent. However, the food was rather sub-standard. I had a tasteless cheese ravioli dish.

I was very hungry but I waited till everyone board which was over an hr of course, later she called my name then she gave me a new boarding pass she said go in, like I had no choice. So I get on the plane, after takeoff I grabbed my book and found my original boarding pass with a seat that the attendant just gave a free earpiece to, and I was just charged for one. I realized she had given my seat away to someone else and give me a broken seat. When I point it out to the flight attendant she said there's nothing they can do for me that the flight is full (with empty first class seats of course) however she will send a red code to the counter at the exit, and go talk to an agent when landed which I did - at the counter in FLL she completely ignored me.

Even three hours before. Exit was available but didn't give us without charge. No customer service as I expect. Was supposed to ask at gate, waited 20 Min and the answer was ""No, flight full.

Further, despite being very approachable they maintained a highly professional approach. In respect of the food, there was a good range on the menu and the ""hot food"" was actually hot. The only small downside re refreshments was that we were not provided with the usual pre-flight drink on our way back from Portland.

I was worried about traveling in light of the negative publicity surrounding different airlines, especially traveling with a 5 year old, a 2 year old and infant. Allowing us to board first and get settled was very helpful as well as allowing us to check car seats, strollers at no cost. But the best part was when we were coming back and my 2year old grandson had had enough refusing to buckle, wanting to get out of his seat, etc. We were in the very back seat next to the stewardesses seat.

Shuttled across the airport and boarded to find that we were delayed because they had to verify the switch (due to a faulty turbo needed for Alaska but not Los Angeles) and because we had too much fuel (again, needed for Alaska not LA). Then because during the now 90 min wait with no air conditioning on a 85+ degree day* we'd used gas from one side of the plane and not the other so it had to be siphoned over.

Delta Air Lines,1,Richard Callis,5th September 2017,"✅ Verified Review | A new level of awful. My curiosity got the better of me. Could Delta be as bad as everyone I knew told me it was. I should have trusted my instinct. A clapped out old A330, clapped out cabin design, the seat to be fair was comfortable and I did get a good sleep. Dinner service did not happen as they did not have enough beef to cater for the needs of their business passengers. Sat in seat 4J I was surprised to learn that you need to sit on the ""captains side"" of the plane if you want to get your choice of meal with Delta. The crew member I spoke to was wholly disinterested in any form of complaint and said ""Listen what do you want?"" Naturally I considered approaching the purser on the plane to speak to him about perhaps guiding his staff on how to deal with premium passengers. When I learned a few moments later that this guy was the purser I realised that my night was over and this was a bus service to Atlanta and that I should expect no level of service whatsoever. Looking for good things. The seat, thats it. Bring your own food, don't expect any manners, get on the bus, sit down, shut up and you'll get to your destination in one piece. I spend a lot of my own money flying in a style that I like to enjoy. Delta failed, failed and failed again. I regret that I now have to continue flying on to Paris with Delta.

The Delta First Class seat looks like a 1990s long-haul business class seat, with the difference it does not recline and there is no footrest. Food selection very limited (sandwich or chicken salad), I took the salad and quality was overall good; beverages selection limited as well and a Chardonnay served in a plastic glass before take.off is something simply meaningless (especially if during dinner proper glasses are used). Crew - like in the previous long-haul flight - seemed a bit too ""casual"", which can be easily misunderstood with unprofessional (I have been more than once addressed as ""honey"" during the flight).

Delta Air Lines,1,S Johnson,30th August 2017,"✅ Verified Review | My son is in the military in Killeen Tx, he has a four day weekend coming up and wants to come visit. I purchased his tickets from Killeen to Panama City (United) for August 31 and the return trip on Delta for September 4th. Unfortunately Harvey happened and United had to cancel his outgoing flight to Panama City. I called JustFly (the online ticketing agency) and Delta to request a refund for the return trip due to the fact that my son will not be in Florida due to the cancelled flight (if he is not in Florida, he cannot utilize a flight from Florida). Justfly said they needed some sort of waiver from Delta to process a cancellation and refund, Delta said that the flight was not affected by Harvey and therefore there will be no refund. My son only had that 4 day available to come visit, yet Delta was very proud that they were willing to waive the change fee, and were gracious to give me a credit that could be used anytime before August 2018. I told them that the only reason I had to cancel the flight was because my son will not be in Florida, it only makes sense that if he is not here he cannot board a plane here. I was also informed that if I did not call Delta back on September 4th to cancel his reservation I would be charged a no show fee (funny how me being on the phone (with both Delta and Justfly for a total of 4hrs, did not qualify as notice that he would not be on the return trip, of a trip he cannot take!). I can see having an issue if someone was just willy nilly changing their minds about traveling, sure charge me a change fee, but when you are physically unable to take a trip due to circumstances beyond your control (Harvey has closed down Texas), then the airline should consider the circumstances and provide a refund and cancellation without fees or penalties in hopes that the traveller would remember how gracious the airline had been and would make sure to fly that airline in the future. Unfortunately Delta is not that type of provider, so if you are reading this review I suggest that maybe you shop elsewhere just in case (god forbid) a similar situation happens and you are stuck not able to get your money back.

Cabin configuration with a staggered 1-2-1, seat itself very old but sort of ok (narrow though). The worst of this flight is the inflight service, seems at Delta they don't take their premium customers seriously; food below par (entree cold, beef fillet hard as a stone); presentation so poor (when you put some warm bread on my tray, why on Earth should you put it on the butter so that it melts everywhere?). Cabin crew attitude too casual for a business class cabin. IFE in such a small screen that some smartphones are bigger; new business class blanket (by Westin) is oddly covered - on the supposedly external face in a very hard and ""plastic""-look-and-touch material which I fail to understand.

Delta Air Lines,8,D Collard,20th August 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Victoria-Seattle-Atlanta-Washington (DCA), Delta Comfort+ class, outbound on 2 August 2017, returning 10 August, using points accumulated with KLM plus $400 in taxes and fees. In both directions, YYJ-SEA legs were served by SkyWest using CRJ-700 aircraft; SEA-ATL legs used B757 outbound and A321 for the return; ATL-DCA legs used A321s in both directions. For all legs, interior cabins were clean and modern (even the B757, a model that Boeing stopped manufacturing in 2003). A321s were brand-new, but nevertheless had the seating design problem of wasting several centimetres of available fuselage width owing to an unnecessary gap between the window-seat armrests and fuselage. A321s also had the new narrower washroom design. A pregnant or significantly overweight passenger would have difficulty turning around inside. Delta categorizes its passengers under many rubrics – Comfort Class, Comfort+ Class, Delta One Class, SkyPriority Class, Medallion Class, Premium Cabin, Main Cabin, and so on. The only clearly-named category I recognised was ""First Class"". I didn't think any of my flights had a ""First Class"", but, on one of my outbound flights, the gate agents nevertheless announced it as one of the groups for early boarding (even in advance of parents with small children and passengers using wheelchairs!). By the end of my trip, I discovered that my ""Comfort+ Class"" ticket was considered also to be in the ""Premium Cabin"" and ""SkyPriority Class"" categories, which all overlapped. A full set of definitions should have been provided as part of the ticket. IFE offered a decent selection of audio and video, but the categorisation made no sense: better to look for the full A-Z listing. For Comfort+ class, ""snacks"" were offered; but the only real food was a banana. Alcoholic beverages were supposed to be available without additional charge for Comfort+ passengers, but at no time did the FAs explicitly say so. Outbound, the ATL-DCA leg was cancelled, as were three other Delta flights that evening serving the same route. Delta apologised profusely, explaining that thunderstorms in the US northeast corridor had prevented flights from landing at DCA and mentioning air-traffic-control congestion as a contributing factor. Oddly, after I arrived in Washington the next day, friends told me they could recall no rain or thunderstorms in Washington the night before. Passengers on the cancelled flights were required to stay overnight at ATL at our own expense. Many passengers did their own rebooking of flights online. Only one Delta agent was present at the service counter near the gate to do rebooking in person. Nearby were Delta telephones where rebooking agents could be reached, but few people noticed them. For overnight lodging, Delta gave us a print-out saying that it had a ""negotiated rate"" with a nearby motor hotel, although it didn't make an outright recommendation. It was a seedy place, well worn and with visible damage to walls and fixtures. It is unwise for Delta to associate its name with that motor hotel. I had one G&T on the ATL-SEA return leg. The FA had no idea how the drink should be poured, even though I'd done my best to ask her to (i) give me a cup with a couple of ice cubes, then (ii) give me the little bottle of gin (they offered Bombay Sapphire), and then (iii) let me pour the tonic water as the last step. She kept giving me a combination of ice and tonic water first, for me to add the gin as the last step.

Delta Air Lines,1,S Maltan,17th August 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Chicago to Salt Lake City. Can someone please tell me why when I make my reservations weeks is advance, I am not given the option to select a seat? Then when I check in 24 hrs in advance, they again will not give me an option to select a seat? Then, I have to go to the counter to get a seat even assigned to me. Then, when I request an isle or a window I am told (with a sarcastic laugh) no due to it being an oversold flight? How again an oversold flight is my problem? I followed protocol and I get punished as a customer. I tried Delta again after a while of not using them due to similar issues, but I am sorry to say it's back to American Airlines for me. I'm sure Delta will never read this and even if they do they won't care, I'm just trying to protect fellow passengers who spend their hard earned money on this ridiculous company.

Delta Air Lines,1,M Roeseger,17th August 2017,✅ Verified Review | We decided to fly from NYC to Miami return with because we had a coupon from an earlier flight we had to cancel. It was just a small amount they gave us back but we thought it's worth it to use it. But after what happened to us on august 2 we will never book with delta again. Our plane was scheduled for 7:02 pm (August 2nd) but then they kept delaying the flight for 3 hours and it kept getting more. Around 8 we saw that other flights would depart earlier then ours (by that time 12:30) so we tried to check if there were other seats available on other planes ! That was the time when we read that the flight got cancelled! We did not get informed by delta nothing! It was not even on the board. So we went to the gate agent to talk with them but the people we talked to didn't understand our situation at all. We literally had to beg them to help us. My boyfriend called the number they gave us to at least get a coupon or anything that could help us out. But nothing. Even when I asked them for blankets they got mad. Just because we didn't want to accept that they are allowed to treat us like that just because the flight got canceled due bad weather conditions in New York. Now was the time we gave up hope and decided to stay next to other people sleeping on the Floor waiting for our flight to depart at 11:10 am! Which means we spent more than 16hours at the airport waiting to fly to Atlanta before we finally got the chance to fly back to New York. In Miami we ended up sleeping on a bench. But the benches there are the hardest I ever sat on so it was pretty much impossible to sleep. I swear that was the first and definitely the last time in my life I fly with delta.

My family had a 4 hour layover in Vegas. We asked for boarding pass so we could go out to grab a bite. They guy first said he couldn't until an hour prior to our flight. We had to explain why we needed our pass before he printed our pass. While doing this he made a couple rude statement, ""how many people do you have? Making me work"" are they not here to help? Next time I'll make sure the person is having a good day before asking about my seats. After all said and done everybody is sitting alone. With a group of 14, five are kids.

Delta decides to delay a plane with approximately 25 people for 3 hours because ""a flight attendant got lost"". So needless to say, my son missed his first connection, now will miss the second connection (and last flight to Florida by the way) and now has to stay at the airport until the next flight after 8am tomorrow.

Delta Air Lines,7,P Manston,12th August 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Ft Lauderdale to Amsterdam via Atlanta. I am a Diamond Medallion, almost 2 million mile flyer. I have flown Delta forever and stand behind the company as (generally) nearly world-class. On this trip I really needed some help, asked for it, and was ignored by Delta. I flew FLL-ATL-AMS, travelling in Delta One and First Class, connecting in AMS to KLM for onward travel. I bought the flight on Delta.Com and despite have a 1:04 connection time in ATL did not see the timing as a problem. Bad weather in ATL delayed us and, oddly, FLL agents boarded the flight, then unboarded, then immediately reboarded the airplane. While in the terminal waiting to reboard I asked a Redcoat to notify ATL of my close connection and asked for “meet and assist” help upon arrival. I watched him type in the request and listened as he read it to me. We arrived in ATL on an A gate with 24 minutes to spare – my AMS departure was leaving from an E gate. Of course, no one was there to assist and the one gate agent had his hands full with normal gate arrival activities. While running to the connections train I saw on a departures board that the AMS flight, which had been showing on-time on the Delta mobile app, was now delayed 30 minutes. Not sure what to believe I hustled to the E gate, where boarding had not even begun. I am disappointed because on this trip I needed help from Delta and got blown off. As a passenger asking for help I hoped they would step up. I am hugely disappointed in their lack of response.

No calling passengers names and flight left missing many passengers from the wait line.

The service workers are as good as they can be but the policy makers have put all these folks in a bad spot cramming tons of people in tight spaces.

Because I was in transit, I didn't havethe right to go out of the airport to the hotel that was offered by the airline. I was the only customer in this situation, so they managed my problem by giving me a mattress, a pillow and a blanket, and told me to sleep in the airport.

Delta Air Lines,2,Matt James,2nd August 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Originally supposed to fly Boston to Vienna via Amsterdam. I arrived at terminal A at the airport in Boston at 13.00 for the 16.45 flight. Check-in took longer than it should. I then went to the Delta skyclub lounge and it was dirty. The food was mediocre. You also have to ask an employee for the wifi password. I went to the gate and the flight started boarding at the normal time. Seats were not the most comfortable, even for business class. A crew member rudely forced me to put my passport in the overhead bin rather than in front of me. I never forget stuff on aircrafts! We were just about to depart when the captain told us there was a delay because of a broken air vent in the cockpit that was just discovered. The plane was sitting at that gate all day. Why didn’t they spot the damage when the plane arrived from Amsterdam that morning? First the crew spent 25 minutes trying to fix the vent in the hot sun with no air conditioning allowed, then another 30 minutes talking on the phone with their maintenance HQ, then they told us there would be a delay until 20.30 at night. We were forced to exit the aircraft so they could take it to the hangar. Now we had 300 people with missed connections waiting in line at the help desk with only 2 employees there. The staff acted uncaring and oblivious and many people were getting very angry with them. When I reached the front of the line the Delta customer service staff told me I couldn’t do anything and I was forced to stay on this delayed flight. They didn’t even look at other options! I did not see them look down at their computer screens when I asked them about re-booking. They probably just want my money. They never updated us on the repair progress but the flight was now delayed until 23.00. At that point I wouldn’t make it back to Austria for another 2 days. I called my travel agent and they successfully rebooked me on a 22.15 Lufthansa flight through Frankfurt. It was on time and everything about that airline (lounge and aircraft) was so much better than Delta! I arrived in Vienna 5 hours later than expected.

Both flights were majorly delayed on my trip and it defeated the purpose of flying. In addition to that, it seemed very prominent with the crew that this is a regular thing. When I go onto the plane, the overhead bins barely fit my carry on purse. I had to fly with my carry on underneath my feet. With all the delay and keeping us at the airport so long, you think they would at least hand out pretzels or water. Nope. Terrible schedule and service. I will never be flying Delta again.

Although that is not the airline's fault, the fact that I had less than 5 minutes to get to my other plane and the crew did not ask for people who were not connecting to wait to disembark so those of us that needed to run could make our connections. Atlanta is a big airport and of course the connecting plane was on the opposite side of the terminal. Once making it to the connecting gate, the customer service representative chuckled when she told the 4 people, that needed that plane, ""yes, that's your plane pulling away"". I slept in the terminal because the next available flight was 9 hours later. Gate changed at least 3 times. I am writing this as I sit on the plane they rebooked me on, supposedly getting ready to go, but actually has sat at the gate with all passengers for over an hour because the underground fuel tanks aren't working.

I decided to cancel and refund my ticket at 2:30AM and just leave as I was going to Reykjavik for the weekend and it would have been a waste. Thankfully the Delta hotline accepted the refund and told I was to receive my money in one week (we'll see how that goes) and that I had to go to baggage service desk in JFK to claim my bag. I filed a baggage request form and was told that it will be delivered to my house in Manhattan by 3:30PM and that the baggage employees arrive at 5:40AM (I had to wait 2.5hrs at least). I had already been at the airport for 8 hours so did not want to wait. Well, now I regret it. Bag never left the plane and boarded the flight to Reykjavik. Not sure how that happened. On July 14, hotline employee told me that it will board the next flight (DL246 KEF-JFK on July 15). I said no problem and did not mind the wait, and I handled this all calmly even though almost all my belongings are in that bag as I am in NY for a few weeks only. I call again today (July 15) and the bag is still in Reykjavik and employee is not sure when it will come back to NY. Honestly I do not mind waiting but to be promised to receive the bag on a day and then for it not to happen not once, but twice, is very poor customer service. After 8 hours in the airport and cancelling my trip, not having my bag with me is the last thing I would want to happen.

Also, while trying to exchange my tickets weeks in advance because my travel dates changed they resorted to outright extortion. They said they would it cost me $200 per ticket to exchange them for flights that were selling from their own website for $106 each.

They even helped some passengers with connecting flights and got them on another flight. After the delay the flight crew were amazing. The pilots got out of the cockpit and addressed everyone face-to-face and apologized for the long delay, which to me showed a high sense of professionalism. The free alcoholic drinks in premium economy were excellent. The snacks were suffice for a short 60 minute flight, just some cookies and pretzels. The seats were highly comfortable and had excellent recline as well. There was no seatback entertainment, however, there were magazines provided.

Delta Air Lines,5,T Mallon,9th July 2017,"✅ Verified Review | London to New York. The flight was delayed by at least two hours due to inclement weather which you could understand and deal with but not unprofessional attitude of the staff. Actually it was just one member who proceeded on three, yes three occasions to ignore me while giving out drinks. Once for a cup of tea, again passed over when offering a bottle of water twice! I get that they need to stretch across to take the window seat person's tray but no excuse me, nothing! One other thing was just before boarding it seemed a little chaotic as people were lining up and did not know which line or where it seemed to be going. The staff were waving you here there and everywhere. Perhaps putting large print signs with more concise info would be more helpful.

Plane landed at 1:12pm, and at 2:10 the baggage was still not listed. Finally, a number of us started asking various employees who would walk by (almost always not a Delta employee but an airport one), and finally someone said ""The board is not correct. Wait for an announcement."" Eventually we were told the bags had been already out on Carousel 4 (and there were dozens of flights from Delta and other carriers, with hundreds if not thousands of people in the whole area).

Delta Air Lines,2,Bassam Helou,6th July 2017,"✅ Verified Review | I was on a Delta flight from Chicago to Los Angeles with a connection at Minneapolis. I had a horrible experience. The layover time was 30 mins, which I knew to be risky because it includes the time it takes to deboard a plane. We landed on time (1 minute early) and the race began. A Delta employee gives me the gate number but doesn't tell me that the connecting gate was at the other end of the terminal and would take a 10 minute walk! Regardless, I arrive at the gate before 30 mins (it took me maybe 28 minutes) but I was told I couldn't board because the airplane door was closed. I was not offered an apology. To make things worse, I had talked to a Delta employee on my way to the gate and asked them to call the delta employees at the connecting gate and let them know that I am on my way. That was the last flight to LA of the day, and I had to sleep on the ground because I wasn't offered a hotel. I took another flight the next day, which fortunately was half empty. Other than the terrible customer service, the plane was clean. However, the wifi wasn't working.

I was amazed by the retrofitted cabin design and how bright it was. Overhead bin was massive and a carry-on suitcase could fit sitting on the side of the suitcase instead of flat as they normally do. I appreciated when the crew kindly reminded every passenger to get to their seat as soon as possible and move away from the aisle to speed up the boarding process, since we started boarding a few minutes behind the scheduled boarding time but arrived in Orlando 20min early. The entertainment system was very amazing and it's even better than those on long haul international flights. Big screen and a lot of movies to choose from.

I was also amazed that the pilot who was standing at the counter also spoke and joked with customers waiting for seat allocation. This is very refreshing and cool. The special treatment continued on the flight with very friendly flight attendants. The snacks provided on this domestic flight is better than what you get on a premium airline in Australia.

We were delayed multiple times by weather related incident to then be told we would be flying when the plane arrives to then be told the flight was canceld as we waited until 1:30 to be told. Waiting around for nothing when we could have been told earlier and either went home or got a hotel and rebooked. Why wait until 1:30am. No compensation or credit or hotel to stay in nothing. Things happen, but to not be taken care of for nothing is a little absurd. Statistics show that if you stayed at a hotel and had an ok experience you would most likely not stay at that hotel. If you had a bad experience, but the staff took care of and made that experience right you would go back at a much higher rate. If only Delta would have done the smallest thing I would def use them again. I will now try and never use them if I have the chance.

There was a man that needed medical attention in the back of the plane and the crew asked overhead if any nurses or doctors could come back. I am an critical care nurse in Seattle, so both me and my sister (also a nurse in Seattle) went back to help. We spent about 15 minutes back there with the man (who turned out okay), but they took our seat numbers in case he needed any more medical attention. Later on in the flight, a flight attendant came by to take our name, email address and home address so that they could give us each a $100 voucher for our services. I was so touched. Delta was kind enough to not only express their gratitude but to give us a reward.

We boarded an older A330-300, from it's registration number it was one of the old Northwest Airlines aircraft, but the layout of the Business First is the latest Delta product.

""Due to weather"" we were in the air for an hour on which I got left behind from my connecting flight. I got to the gate at 10.30 and the flight was departing at 10.40 and the plane left early. I was left behind in an airport and city I don't know. I proceeded to the gate where Delta employees were ""helping"" customers, but in reality they weren't. One employee started yelling at a customer for not standing in a single file line. After waiting for almost an hour to see if I could catch another flight to my final destination, I finally got to the counter and the delta employee was rude, not helpful and wasn't listening to my needs. All he offered was a flight the next day at 12.07 pm and told me if I didn't like it I could get on the phone and find an alternative. So I got on the phone with a Delta representative, explained my situation and she wasn't helpful either. I asked to be put on a flight with the partner airline that was leaving that same night and her response was no. After being on the phone for 45 mins all I got was a flight from atl to Norfolk at 7am. I got to Norfolk at 9.05 so had missed my interview and was also one hour and 30 mins from from my destination.

Delta Air Lines,8,K Strouse,23rd June 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Flew Tampa to Raleigh-Durham. Kudos to Delta for going above and beyond. I bought tickets three months in advance for my mother and I to attend my nephew's graduation assuming prices would start to rise after that. To my surprise, fares lowered dramatically a few weeks after my purchase. I had originally purchased ""Main Economy"" tickets, Delta's middle tier in economy. Upon seeing the new lower prices, I called Delta who offered to upgrade us to Delta Comfort+, their top tier in economy which offers more legroom, advance boarding and guaranteed overhead bin space. The ticket price of the upgraded seats was lower than what I had paid for Main Economy and Delta's response was to issue each of us the $49 fare difference in vouchers for future travel (which we will definitely use this year before expiry) even though they were under no obligation to do so. My mother requires wheelchair assistance and this was handled flawlessly on both ends of both flights. Both flights left slightly late but arrived on time on the outbound and early on the return. Outbound seat very uncomfortable, return was fine. We had ""bulkhead"" seats both ways on these regional flights and as there is no wall separating First and Economy we were able to stow belongings under the First seat in front of us avoiding the bulkhead inconvenience of having to stow everything in the overhead. Crew polite, helpful and professional on both flights. On the return crew pilfered First snacks in order to provide my mother with a nut and seed free option. WiFi was provided though I did not attempt to use it so cannot comment on speed.

Delta Air Lines,2,John Davies,22nd June 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Manchester to Boston via New York. I am disgusted by the way Delta treat their customers. My wife and I booked through Virgin a return flight Manchester to Boston via New York. Besides the flight being cancelled from New York to Boston their staff were non existent. We arrived in New York delayed but with a time that was tight as you have to go through security and immigration. After panicking a little we found the flight was delayed. We set off to the boarding gate. I am disabled and require a mobility scooter to get around so I was waiting patiently for Delta member of staff to check us out as usual. This never happened. To cut a long story short the flight while we sat waiting was delayed four time was coming from two different Airports and then cancelled. We were directed by an announcement that we had to go to a certain area in the airport to ascertain what to do next. We arrived at the named area and there was a queue. After waiting for about thirty minutes a staff member came out and said that we should go to another area. This we did it was a long way to go we reached the area and again a queue - after about thirty minutes we got to the desk. I iterated to the staff member that we had been travelling for over 20 hours and I was very sore. The staff member asked my wife to go around the back to look at the screen. I was unable to and also never asked to. The staff member was showing my wife that we were entitled to a hotel because I was disabled. I find this distasteful as surely anyone delayed due to the airline failings were entitled. Anyway we asked how we should get there and produced a voucher for a taxi. We were then told how to get to the taxi stand. I asked about our bags as my medication was in there. We were told to go to another office which was baggage claim. On arriving there we asked about the bags and we were refused. We went to the taxi stand and tried to find the taxi company asking one of the drivers he was not easy to understand he said it was his taxi. I was put in the back by means of ramps and I only just got in. The taxi driver did not know where the hotel was my wife caught a glimpse of it and showed it to the driver. Arriving at the hotel he wanted another voucher for the return journey next day. We did not have one. We ordered a taxi through the hotel, as I could not go through that again costing $40. Arriving at JFK we proceeded to the gate and guess what another delay. I thought here we go again. At the new take off time an hour delay there was further discussion as to how they would handle my mobility scooter and after one member of staff who seemed to be the group leader refusing to load it as they had not been trained. After a long discussion I was allowed to go to the Aircraft doors and my scooter was taken away. My thoughts were I was never going to see it again. I was directed to a seat,which was difficult to get in due to my disability and then found my wife was seated elsewhere. We arrived at Boston and went to retrieve our cases and found they were not there. My wife thought she spotted them some way from the area and sure enough it was them. We were then told that they had come on an earlier flight. It would of been helpful and customer focused to tell us that in the beginning The return flight was also a nightmare but I am not in mood to go on as it gets me more angry by the thought of it",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Boston via New York,May 2017,1,1,2,2,1,1,no

I'm mad that I have to sit in the airport for 6 more hours. How is Delta so stupid? Now there are less seats on the later flight to possibly sell, and they just chose to anger five international travelers who have families of their own.

Delta Air Lines,1,S Ragmani,22nd May 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Richmond to Johannesburg via Atlanta. I was very disappointed with Delta Airlines, I booked my ticket to Zimbabwe on January 28th, 2017 for a trip in May 2017. I purchased separately a Delta Comfort seat for an additional total of $418 because I knew the 16 hour non stop flight to and from ATL to JNB was long. This reservation was done over the phone since I needed the assistance of a Delta agent to book a ticket from JNB to HRE and from HRE to JNB. When it came to checking in 24 hours prior to my trip on the 1st of May, the online system would not let me check in online. I had to call a Delta agent to assist with checking in. After being on the phone for over an hour, the agent had to redo my reservation under a new record locator and confirmation number. According to this agent, the reason why it would not let me check in was because there was a Date of Birth mismatch. The agent assured me that my seating remained intact, and just the confirmation had changed. I was finally able to check in. When boarding at RIC airport, all of a sudden, the agent gave me a new seat number which was NOT the original seat number I reserved. When I arrived in ATL, my boarding pass wouldn't scan. I was supposed to board with the SKY priority zone, but could not. I was supposed to be on seat 31F which was a delta comfort seat. The agent told me that they were checking to see if my luggage had transferred to the flight. I thought that was an odd response. All of a sudden, I have a new boarding pass with a new seat number 53E and they just reassigned me with no notice or explanation. I located the seat thinking it was another Delta Comfort seat, but it my dismay, it was a basic economy class seat. I reported this mix up immediately to one of the stewardess. She got the agent that reassigned my seat. This agent claimed they did not have a record of my purchasing economy comfort seat, yet it was on the documentation that I presented to him. I insisted that I wanted my original seat back, but of course he was totally unwilling to help or do anything to look into it.He totally disregarded me and ignored everything i had to say and walked away. Now, I was told to take the economy seat as there were not delta comfort seats available as the plane was getting ready to takeoff. I had no choice but to do so. As a delta skymiles member, I was lied to by these agents and was very disrespected. If Skymiles members are treated this way and based on this experice, I will certainly cancelling my skymiles membership and delta gold credit card after being treated like trash. I also will not be recommending delta as customer service oriented airline. In my opinion, Delta demonstrated bad business practice, by relinquishing my comfort seat when it was already paid for.

We followed up with check in procedure, signing in to schedule our seating at 4:33pm, 24 hours before our flight. The check in opened at 4:30pm on May 18th. 3 minutes into check in all of the seats were booked. So on our honeymoon we are having to sit separately. My husband then called Delta Airlines and spoke to a representative that stated it was a full flight, and for us to speak to the front desk representative at our terminal for accommodations. We arrive at the airport today and waited in line. After hearing an announcement stating that there are several unassigned seats currently and not to worry, that a seat assignment would be given to the individuals when they board the plane. When we did our check in yesterday we had a choice of 2 separate individual seats rows apart from each other even though we booked our tickets 7 whole months in advance. The representative greeted us when we came up to the desk and let us know that no accommodations would be made for our situation even though it was a special occasion for us. She brushed us off and asked us to please take a seat. I am dissappointed. We recently flew with Delta earlier this year and I was highly impressed with their level of organization and professionalism. We travelled with our family of 14 people and were able to book 3 full rows of seats for our whole family with no issues. I am sad on the first day of our trip that no accommodations could have been made for my new husband and I when we followed procedure and planned so meticulously.

Slept on the floor of JFK Airport tell 8am the next morning then spent $60.00 of my money to check into the Delta Club, yes I got to take a shower and eat and rest, but I feel that of no fault of mine, Delta could have made a little effort to hold the connecting flight for 8 minutes or help all the folks that were in the same position as I was for 24 hours.",not known,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boise to Dublin via New York,May 2017,4,5,5,5,4,3,no

Last year at this time we flew Heathrow to Seattle and Seattle to Portland and it was a wonderful experience especially on the way back because at Portland I was asked to checkin my hand luggage and garment bag. The garment bag didn't make it but after a Delta supervisor made a number of calls the bag was on the next flight and our pilot said on arrival at Heathrow he would let us know if the bag made it. To my amazement after a long flight leaving an hour late but arriving on time he told me at the exit that my bag was indeed on board. What fantastic service. I sent email to Delta but never even got an acknowledgement of it. This year from Amsterdam direct to Portland on DL179 we were called back to the gate because of a security issue. Bags on board but not the passengers who owned them? Not Delta's fault. But on a 10 hour + flight you would expect not to have to be reaching for Jerseys, hoodies & gloves to keep warm. Lots of passengers complained about it being freezing for the whole flight (it was colder than the cold water served up).

Delta Air Lines,4,T Denby,9th May 2017,"✅ Verified Review | So disappointing. We've used Delta for international travel many times and had no problems. Internal US domestic travel has been so different. First of all they took our hand luggage off us and told us they had to check them. If we weren't prepared and had a smaller bag each we would of had to scramble and find something to put our essentials in as they didn't care and said there's no room, they need to be checked in. We had a multi leg flight but were told we wouldn't be allowed our luggage for any of the flights even though there might be room on the last flight. The flights themselves were fine, friendly staff and relatively on time. Just minutes late nothing bad. The next night is when we land at Daytona, the last flight and one of our bags doesn't turn up. Luckily an agent was still on site and told us that unfortunately the bag didn't get on the flight at Denver and that instead of being sent to Atlanta they sent it to Minneapolis. The bag is ""hopefully"" going to be on the 11am flight tomorrow which we have to go and pick up ourselves! If not they've told us it's going to be a problem as we are moving resorts everyday as we are on a touring holiday.

I used miles which apparently they treat you like a 2nd class citizen which is insane because that means you fly often. I almost missed my first flight out on my connection due to them being late and having to wait for my carry on. They then made me feel bad about it. When I had booked my flight I had to pick an airport 2 hours from home because they were out of my nonblack out tickets. I tried to get my flight switched which they had flights for and they said yes and then changed their mind and said no. Now I go to check in and my flight is running late and I will most likely miss my connection. When I got frustrated they just told me it isn't their fault and I have no right to be upset. Then I asked it they can do anything and they said no it isn't our problem. I will now get home a day later. Terrible customer service.

Delta Air Lines,3,Raymond Biller,23rd April 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Flying on Delta today has been one of the worst experiences I've had flying with any airline. My original departure for return started in Brunswick followed by a horrendous stop in Atlanta. Upon arrival at approx 230 pm I was directed to a boarding gate in terminal A gate 17. A short hour later they changed the gate to terminal A gate 31. A short hour later the flight was changed to terminal B gate 33. Keep in mind at no time was an announcement ever made for gate change, the unmanned tv screen just miraculously changed without notice. Just when we thought it was over and by we I mean the several passengers in wheelchairs, and those needing assistance to board, we're notified that 2 mins prior to boarding time they had changed gates again. This time we would have to run essentially to terminal E gate 35. Some arrived approx 10 mins after scheduled boarding including myself to be told that the flight will mow be pushed back because it flew in from Colombia and needed to be cleaned. I approached the gate representative and notified him that my next leg from Seattle was international and that the new arrival time only allows a 30 minute window between arrival time and actual departure of my next leg international to Victoria, Canada. The response I got was priceless and he typed my name into the computer to verify and suddenly looked up with a smile as he said I guess you should run when you get there! While I wanted to laugh I also realized it's probably not a good time as a rep to be making jokes to passengers who have been re-gated 4 times and may or may not make it home to their family on time or even the same day. Professionalism and some punctuality is important if you wish for customers to return and in this case as I heard from the crowd numerous times Delta lost many return customers to include myself.",,Business,Economy Class,Brunswick to Victoria via Atlanta / Seattle,April 2017,4,4,4,4,1,1,no

When we boarded the flight attendants asked our names, where we were from and treated us like gold. But, then we got to Minneapolis. We asked politely if there were any upgrades available and the gate agent answered the most condescending ""you do that when you book. Who told you that you could come here and ask me for this?!"" I was stunned. Not just stunned frankly insulted and angered. Paying customers should never be treated with such contempt and outright disgust.

Of the 16 of us, baggage was delayed for 5!! For one person, it was delayed for 2 days (out of a 7 day trip!). The Guatemalan baggage attendant did not provide a file reference number to us (which we needed for baggage charge reimbursement purposes), so I just completed an online letter to them explaining why I cannot complete their online form (wasting more of my time). Additionally, on the trip home, we actually happened to get upgraded to a ""comfort plus"" seat. The desk attendant told us it cost an extra $100 for these seats and we would get a complementary drink if we desired. The leg room was definitely better, but that was it. We were never offered any drink, and the service/attention we received was no different than in economy - which, in my opinion, was also sub-par. With the financial windfall airlines have enjoyed the last few years, I would expect more - and also cannot understand why they charge for 1 checked bag at all! In sum, this Delta experience was mediocre.",Boeing 757,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Guatemala City via Atlanta,March 2017,3,2,2,5,5,3,no
Delta Air Lines,1,Kimberly Seckler,14th March 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Worst customer service I have received. I had a flight from Houston to New York scheduled for today, Monday the 13th, and have been calling to adjust my flight due to the storm since Friday. I was told numerous times that my flight would not be affected by this storm and that in order to change my flight I would need to pay a change fee and the difference. This is completely unacceptable when you have customers being proactive and willing to take earlier flights. I was more than willing to pay the difference in the flight, but no fee waiver was offered. After 4 calls and no help from any customer support representative my flight has now been canceled with no option but to fly out mid-day Wednesday.

Delta Air Lines,9,P Andrews,11th March 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Excellent transcon on DL1290 from Atlanta to San Francisco in first class on a refurbished B757. Flight departed on time and arrived about 10 minutes late. Weather was forecast to be turbulent but pilot altered course and altitude to provide a smooth ride. First class flight attendant was first class. Friendly, energetic, and a pleasure to fly with. Service was fast, food was decent, and glasses were refilled. Noticed that wine is now served from a full bottle, which is a nice upgrade. The B757, while an oldie, had a completely new cabin with in-seat power, personal TV screen, and wifi. The wifi didn't work well on all four segments of my trip. Not sure if it is Delta's receivers, traffic load, or the fact that Gogo doesn't support their connection app anymore, but it took over 45 minutes to connect on each flight. (Gogo was great on Virgin America the week before). Fast gate arrival and my baggage was on the carousel at SFO before I made it to the arrivals level. Baggage was priority tagged and handled accordingly, except they ripped off my luggage ID tag. From chocks down to exiting the SFO parking garage was 5 minutes tops.

The flight from Charlottesville was delayed by 30 minutes, making me very afraid that I would miss my connecting flight in NY as the turnaround was very quick. Made it to La Guardia and ran to the Gate listed on my boarding pass, only to learn that the Gate had been switched. I was never notified and there was no announcement made. The flight from La Guardia left 35 minutes late. Onboard that flight, I was seated in the one row on the entire plane that was skipped for snacks/drinks. No apologies were made, and no one even acknowledged us at all. It felt as though we were intentionally being ignored. All in all, I feel quite disrespected and don't intend to fly with Delta again.

Delta Air Lines,1,R Neale,1st March 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Jackson Hole to Reno via Salt Lake City. Weather mishap, compounded by lack of sympathy and poor customer service. Initial flight delayed 2 hours. Missed connection by 10 minutes. No attempt to get me off the plane (or the other 10 people on that connection) quicker was made. We possibly could have made that flight if we were allowed to exit first. Second, calling help line I asked when the next flight out was, she said ""tomorrow"" and laughed. They offer no protection for weather delays, I was given a toothbrush kit with bathroom essentials after lying on the terminal carpet for nine hours. I purchased a bottle of whiskey and put it in my carry-on in Jackson after checking with airline security that this was allowed. The next day, they actually tried to charge me to check my carry-on or dump the bottle out. Since I bought my own hotel room and left the terminal, this bottle was no longer considered safe. When I asked them to comp it as an ""I'm sorry how poor your flight was"" the check in lady said, ""it not like it's our fault you bought whiskey"" - after asking her supervisor, they comped the whiskey.

Delta Air Lines,8,J Choo,24th February 2017,"✅ Verified Review | New York to Buffalo return. On both flights, check-in and luggage drop-off at the airports were a breeze with hardly any need to queue. Several check-in desks were available. On my return flight, I reached the airport about 1.5 hours to departure and again, there was no need to queue. There were many kiosks available for self check-ins. Baggage drop-off and counter check-ins all took place at the counters. I appreciated the ease of joining a single queue that handled both check-in and baggage drop-off. The customer service person attended to my check-in baggage, tagged it, and brought it straight to the conveyor belt behind the counter, all in one station. This was so much easier compared to another US airline I flew with last year, also out from JFK, where I had to join 3 separate queues at 3 separate stations: one for check-in, then another one to have my luggage weighed and tagged, and a third station to drop off my baggage. The areas surrounding these 3 stations were, needless to say, crowded. chaotic and messy. For the passengers, I cannot imagine it being a superior experience than having one station that handles everything from check-ins to luggage drop-off. Boarding for both flights were orderly and according to frequent flyer status, premium or economy seats and zones. The planes were small and did not have a lot of storage space was available but the airline allows passengers to place their larger hand carry bags at the aero bridge prior to boarding which were then brought by handlers to be loaded in the cargo hold. On the out-going flight, free pretzels, cookies or peanuts were offered to passengers in economy with free drinking water. On the return flight, there were free pretzels or cookies with free water, tea, coffee and I believe soft drinks too. The captains made announcements at the beginning of each flight on the traffic at the airport and the expected take off time. The outgoing flight was on time but the return flight experienced a 20 mins delays. Passengers were able to access entertainment programmes like movies, sticoms, etc, through their own devices by logging into Delta Studio using the wifi onboard. The access to the entertainment programme which had a good selection of American and foreign movies is free. This was my first short haul experience with Delta. I experienced a Europe-US flight with Delta last year on A KLM ticket which was a good one. I would definitely consider flying with Delta again if the ticket price is competitive.",Bombardier CRJ-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Buffalo,February 2017,3,3,3,4,4,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,1,K Oxford,23rd February 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Charlotte. Let me preface by saying this is not against Delta as a whole. It's for the gate agent. The lady working the gate in Atlanta at B29 on 2/23 for the flight to Charlotte at 3:10pm needs some serious lessons in customer service. I understand they have policies and protocols but there's really no need to be blatantly rude to your customers about it. I fly almost weekly with a carry on (that I'm almost always forced to check at the gate), my computer bag and a small purse. The purse can fit inside the computer bag but I wear it as a cross body and just slide it in the computer bag when I get to my seat. As I am walking into the tarmac she makes me stop and consolidate my tiny purse into my laptop bag. After a quick argument saying that it'll fit, I fly with this all the time she forces me to step aside, so I did and then I backed up to be out of the way and she proceeds to yell at me for where I choose to stand and then essentially makes fun of me to the next passenger boarding saying that I clearly didn't understand her the first ten times she said it. For the record, I heard her and I know the rules. I fly enough with the same 3 items and I'm never given a hard time about it. So if she enforces her rules more than others, bravo to a job well done but at least do it with some finesse and class. She's just rude and unprofessional. This is Delta, not a low class airline. The best part was, after I consolidated, they forced me to check my carry on anyways. She could have suggested that from the getgo instead of making a spectacle of me. The 1 out of 10 stars is for her, not Delta.",,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to Charlotte,February 2017,3,4,,,1,5,yes

Delta Air Lines,3,S Hamitz,21st February 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Salt Lake City to Paris. Last time for me to fly Delta. Yes, they provide a comparatively cheap fare from Germany to the US, but on both legs (to and from US) technical troubles with the plane (to US: engine; from US: autopilot) led to substantial delays. Badly enough, the information policy on the ground was non-existent (""just don't go anywhere and wait until we board"") and on my way back my luggage was lost at Paris CDG airport and arrived three days later. Even though the Business Class product is not bad considering the price, the planes (old Boeing 767/757's) are run down and the two technical issues described above are certainly related to the fact that this airline strives at still flying 20+ year old planes on main routes.",Boeing 767-300,Business,Business Class,Salt Lake City to Paris,February 2017,3,4,2,3,1,3,no
Delta Air Lines,1,M Leeson,16th February 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Charlestown to Atlanta via New Orleans. I booked a flight on Delta.com 6 months in advance and at the time was not given an assigned seat at that time. As the trip got closer I tried to see if I could get assigned seats so I was sure my wife and I were sitting together. I was told that there was a $50 upgrade fee in order to get assigned seats. I fly 2-5 times a year and I thought this was strange, I had never heard of this before on any airline. The day before our flights I received an email from Delta that they had changed the times of all of our flights. We booked our flights at specific times because we were meeting another couple in New Orleans. because of the flight change they were going to have to sit in the airpot for 2 hours waiting for us. When we arrived to check in they tried to bump us to an even later flight. on our connecting flight they did the same thing. On the return flight our plane arrived early but the gate was damaged and we had to be towed to another gate. This caused us to miss our connecting flight leaving us stranded in the airport for more than 4 hours. We had to scramble to make arrangements while going from gate to gate in the airport only to get home well after 12am. A 14 hour travel day. After almost two hours on the phone with Delta's support they offered us a $100 voucher. That was my last Delta flight. There are plenty of airlines to choose from.

While in route, nearly arriving at the airport, my boarding pass changed to a 7pm flight. I received no email, no phone call and no text. I called to have this corrected and the representative lied to me and told me that the 7am flight was cancelled so they moved me to the 7pm flight without any form of update. Upon checking with Delta, I found that the 7am flight was still on time to depart. I state again that I had already nearly arrived at the airport by the time I got the notice of the 12 hour change. I have never been so disappointed in my life, I was able to have it changed to a 12pm flight, however this should not have been the case.

Delta Air Lines,1,P Lane,8th February 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Nashville to San Francisco via Salt Lake City. Where to start, we got to Nashville airport with 2 check in bags each (3 of us traveling) and thought it would be easier to check in at the road side counter. The guy there weighed all our bags and then said 'come around this side of the counter and see the total cost for your bags', it was a total of $480 USD for the 6 bags. Now mind you we weighed all our bags before getting to the airport, they were on the limit yes, but he tried to say 1 was close to 60 pound. He then said he would make them all go through for the usual $30 per bag if we 'look after him', so we had to pay him cash (he had a massive amount of cash in his pocket) not so sure if this is Deltas policy. Onboard our leg from SLC to San Fran we asked for a beverage in which we were charged for. We were in Comfort + seating which clearly states on their website and in their brochure in the back of the seat that all drinks including alcohol are free. When asking if this is the case we got a little chuckle and 'argh no mam, no they're not included' and he proceeded to charge us. After re reading the brochure I asked the other attendant who looked at me blankly and said 'yes that's right they're included'. I advised him that his colleague doesn't know this and he has been charging all of us for what's supposed to be included. He had to go and refund everyone one by one. Then to top it off we get to San Francisco airport, get our luggage and my sister in laws brand new Jeep suitcase is distroyed. Literally falling apart. Looks like it had been run over. So off we go to luggage counter and the lady there - while chewing on a lollie - looks at us like we're morons and says 'oh I can get you another one but it won't be a Jeep one sorry'.

Delta Air Lines,2,V Desiratne,4th February 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Tucson to Copenhagen via Atlanta / Paris. I was on a 3 day trip to Copenhagen, Denmark to meet my family, my sister came from London and brother came from Sri Lanka to meet me. I bought the ticket with KLM, but the flight was cancelled and they reschedule my ticket with Delta. My bags were checked in at Tucson to Copenhagen via Atlanta and Paris. However, from the beginning, I had bad experiences, at the check in desk two ladies refused to let me board saying that I do not have a valid visa to travel to France even though I produce them my Danish resident permit which is valid for all Schengen states. They simply gave my passport back saying that I cannot travel to France without a valid visa. (I am a Sri Lankan passport holder with a Danish resident permit). I had to speak to their supervisor, and he issued the boarding passes to only to Paris. Enquired him about the boarding pass from Paris to Copenhagen, he said I can get it from the machine once I arrived in Paris. When I arrived in Paris I tried to print my boarding pass, but I was not able to print it due to the fact that they find my flight reservation CDG to CPH. I had to rush to Air France customer service, and they said Delta has not issued my ticket from CDG to CPH while rescheduling my ticket. After 20 minutes thanks to Air France staff they gave my boarding pass. Once I arrived in Copenhagen my baggage did not appear. Then I asked for assistance at CPH lost baggage services to locate my baggage, and they informed me that they have no record after Atlanta. They asked me to contact Delta customer services agents. I contacted them and they were simply reading back to me what is on the Delta website and asked me to wait or either file a lost baggage complain. As per the telephone conversation with Delta baggage services on Saturday, they said they will deliver the baggage to my United States address as they do not have information regarding my baggage. Saturday the 10th December around 10.30pm they rang me and informed me that my baggage arrived at CPH and they are going to deliver it to my hotel. However, I could not hand over those to him as baggage was delivered to me around 11.00pm Danish time Saturday the 10th December, after my brother left Copenhagen. He flew back to Sri Lanka on the 10th December. I was really stressed out as I had to carry the Christmas gifts back to the US and I have no other way to deliver the gifts before Christmas. Moreover, I have to carry that 16kg back to Denmark next time. I asked them for extra compensation as they ruined my holiday as well as I have to find another way of sending the stuff to my family which I already bought for them. I don't think anyone would spend the US $1200 just for 3 days travel if the trip is not really important. Due to their mistake, my holiday was ruined and I could not fulfil the purpose of my travel.

Delta Air Lines,3,C Lang,14th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Bonaire to Salt Lake City via Atlanta. There were a number of issues on this flight - some beyond the control of the airline. But Delta failed to cater an international flight of over 5 hours duration. There were no first class meals at all and not enough coach meals to go around. Passengers were asked to share which was OK because the sandwich they provided to me was soggy - almost soaking wet and smelled so bad I refused to eat it in any event. Beverages were also in short supply and at the end of the flight as a first class passenger I was offered a choice of Diet Coke or tomato juice only. According to staff the plane should have been catered for the return flight in Atlanta and that did not get done. Flight crew advised that they had asked the terminal staff in Bonaire to make an announcement that if you wanted food or drink you needed to buy it before boarding. If that was done neither myself or anyone I talked to in first class heard the announcement. Flight crew promised that Delta would have a representative at the gate in Atlanta to do something for our inconvenience - that was a pipe dream. Due to the delays I had to run to clear customs, immigration and make my next flight out of Atlanta - also in the first class cabin but with no meal service. So I had a 12 hour travel day with a soggy, inedible sandwich and two bags of chips.

On our return journey 10/01/17, our flight was delayed again and we were not sure if we had missed the connecting flight to London Heathrow as again we were not given any information. We were very anxious about missing the flight again, and we left our camera on the aircraft. We were in a queue for immigration for two hours - no information was forthcoming despite repeated requests for information as it was likely we could be re-booked for the 09.37 flight later that evening. We were told by one of the border agents that if we did not like waiting that we should not visit the United States. We then arrived at re-booking and had to wait a further 30 minutes to be told that we had been booked on the next flight which was leaving in 5 minutes and that we should run to the boarding gates. We pushed our way through the security ran all the way to the shuttle train, down corridors and up escalators and got to the gate to be told the flight had gone and there was nothing they could do. We were given a voucher to stay at the Ramada Plaza hotel. We did not have any hand luggage as this was checked on the flight but we were told we could collect an overnight pack. The queue for this appeared a further 30 minute wait so we headed off to the hotel. We arrived at the hotel to queue for a further 30 minutes before being allocated a room for the night. We were told that food vouchers could not be provided as this should have been given by the staff at the airport. We order some food which arrived at 1.00 am in the morning which we paid for using our visa card.

The entertainment has a wide selection of movies, music etc. (when the screens are actually operational) and the seats are not unbearable. My issue is with the airlines lack of accommodation when they have a failure to notify the individual that their flight was cancelled and lack of ability to rebook a flight that is equivalent to the one that was paid for. By missing my flight and not being able to reach the deadlines that are required makes me look unprofessional and weighs heavy on my position.

We booked on Expedia and a day before the flight we got an email reminder showing our seats, etc. We had booked our seats so we were sitting together. Unfortunately, when we got to the airport, we found ourselves sitting in middle seats in different rows. I explained that my wife was pregnant with morning sickness and it would be great if they could at least switch her to a seat in the aisle. But both the girl at check-in and the guy at the gate said they had no seats for us to change to and that we couldn't upgrade. ""Fine,"" I thought, ""sucks for us, but if they have a full plane then there's nothing they can do about it."" The really upsetting thing is that after boarding we saw that there were many seats open just a few rows in front and behind us. Luckily there was a couple sitting next to us that had been similarly split up and we ended up switching with them so we could both sit with our spouses. I don't know what the deal with Delta seat selection is, but given that they couldn't even accommodate my pregnant wife when there were so many empty seats made this our last Delta flight ever. P.S. I found crumbs on my tray table from the previous flight.

Delta Air Lines,1,R Sanyal,4th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Milwaukee to Calgary via Minneapolis. Three of the four flights were inordinately delayed, not because of weather which I would have understood given the season, but because of mechanical problems. The departure time from Milwaukee was constantly pushed back -- to an extent that we missed the connecting flight at Minneapolis. I was assured when the first delay was announced that we would make the connection with the new timing. This happened a second time. We were willing to cancel our tickets and take flights on alternative airlines. But the gate agents were not able to be honest about the actual departure time -- in fact, they said they were only the messengers of the news. In the event, we lost the entire day travelling and reached our destination so late that we had to arrange for alternative transportation because we had missed our previously booked non-refundable transfers -- not to mention the holiday activities we had planned that afternoon and evening. It started our holiday on a very bad note. On the return, early morning flight was delayed for mechanical reasons. However we reached Minneapolis in time to connect. But the connecting flight after travelling down the runaway, gathering speed, suddenly braked and returned to the gate - mechanical problems. An alternative plane was arranged and we reached home several hours later. The ground manager asked us to rate them high for having arranged a replacement plane -- what gall! When you have 3 out of 4 flights on the same type of aircraft of the same airline experience mechanical problems, we have to be very concerned about the maintenance standards and competencies at Delta Airlines.

As a Stage 4 Breast Cancer patient they literally made the start of 2017, a start I will not forget! On January 2nd my friends and I were set to board a Delta flight from Chicago to Paris where we had a layover before getting to Dublin. I made Delta aware two months prior that I needed an accommodation made to have a seat in Bulk as I had just finished chemo in September and my oncologist wanted me up moving and stretching throughout the flight. Unfortunately, upon arriving to check in, I noticed that this hadn't been done, but explained my situation to them and they kindly placed me in an appropriate seat. Prior to boarding my name was called and they had decided to move me into business class. In addition when they found out I was flying with friends they moved their seats up to premium economy, so that I would be able to easily be able to walk up and down the aisles and talk with them. Throughout the flight the staff checked on me and my friends as well. Delta Airlines has a Breast Cancer Research Foundation and this is the first time that I've actually seen a company represent the Pink Ribbon so well!

It was hot, and after a 26 hour flight time makes one grumpy. Return was fair, food was fair. Real downside was a delayed departure from Beijing to Detroit and then boarding the plane in Detroit to Minneapolis to be treated rudely by attendant for being late after I practically ran from getting my luggage to go through customs then to the boarding gate.

And the compensation for the first leg of the flight was minimal and wasn't even offered until after several hours on the phone and we had to make the request. Delta was the only airline with lines longer than space available for lines on both legs of the trip, so clearly it's a consistent and internal issue.

Delta Air Lines,1,Donna Radford,20th December 2016,"✅ Verified Review | Dane County to Louisville via Detroit. I volunteered to take a later flight because they overbooked my original flight. The gate agents offered a $400 travel voucher to people willing to fly on a later flight. I volunteered and the gate agent told me he booked me on a later flight that day. My original flight ends up being about 1.5 hours delayed and at the end of boarding for the earlier flight the gate agents called my name up to the counter. At this point, the earlier flight is taxiing away from the gate and when I get up to the counter the gate agents have no idea why I'm up there. They had literally just called me to the counter and then didn't know why I was up there. Of course this concerned me so I wanted to verify my flight details for later that day. The gate agents had no idea what I was talking about. They had not booked me on that later flight. I had them book me at that point and verified with them I would still get the travel voucher. The gate agents assured me I wold still get the voucher. Of course, a couple weeks go by and nothing shows up in my Delta account so I submit a request. I finally get a call almost 2 months later from someone at Delta headquarters. She let's me know that, ""there were empty seats on the earlier flight and there was no way the gate agents would have offered me a voucher. Since I didn't get booked on the later flight until after the earlier flight, there was no way my story was true."" This entire experience was ridiculous and I will never volunteer to change flights ever again and any chance I can use United instead of Delta, I will.

Delta Air Lines,1,Stephanie Bradley,20th December 2016,"✅ Verified Review | I was taking what was to be a simple flight from Phildelphia to Chicago with a quick stopover in Detroit. When I landed in Detroit (before 8am), I saw that the flight had been delayed by an hour. This was not a bad thing, given that my original flight would have been boarding by the time I landed and I needed to get from an A gate to a B gate. That flight landed, deplaned, some crew arrived and got on board, and we are waiting, and waiting. They told us we were waiting for a First Officer, they had no idea where he was but hadn't shown up. So while we waited, the crew for our flight timed out. So, they send us a few gates down, where we waited for a flight that was coming in from Minneapolis. This was delayed, then delayed some more, then mechanical issues, then for two hours they told us the plane had pulled away from the gate, but hadn't taken off yet. From what I can tell, the plane never did, and I am not convinced there even was a plane coming. So, at around 3 something, they move us yet again from a B gate, back over to an A gate. Here, the gate agent told me there was a 5:40 flight, but that this flight was scheduled to take off at 5:25, so I should stick with that. All things were looking good (9 hours later) to get this 5:25 flight out. Plane lands on time, plane deboards, some crew get on board, and we are all eagerly anticipating geting on and getting home. Then they start delaying us in 10 minute incriments. Now, while it seemed like some sort of sick joke, the announcement comes across that once again they cannot find a pilot or the first officer. So we waited, and waited, and waited. The horrible realization was creeping up that time was of the essence and I likely was not going to get home that day for no good reason. There was one final flight out that night at 8:30. I went to customer service, where she was anything of customer friendly, but I finally got one of the last two seats available on that flight. She told me I had been switched to the 5:40 flight and missed it, which I had never been told happened and had been given a boarding pass and seat assignment for the flight I was standing waiting on. She accusingly said, ""Well here you go Stephanie, if that's even your name"" as she handed me my boarding pass for the 8:30 flight. Not the slightest bit of an apology as I had been stuck there at this point for 11 hours at nobodys fault but Delta. My time is more valuable then a box of snacks and sack of food from Wendys that were tried to buy me off or passify me. I eat organic, gluten free foods, so that wasn't helping my missed work or hunger. Of course no vouchers were offered, as Delta doesn't offer that, nor was any comfort provided in the Sky Club as I was told that was a different branch. All in all we took off a bit after 9pm after being stuck in Detroit for 13 hours. Some may try to say this was a case of winter weather. That is a lie. This was poor planning, negligence, poor service, and a cheap airline that has no consideration for it's customers well being. I travel 60% of the time for work and for the most part am the decision maker on my travel. For the last year and a half I have purposely stopped flying Delta because of too many flight delays, cancellations, and the worst customer service.",,Business,Economy Class,PHL to MDW via DTW,December 2016,3,2,1,3,1,1,no

I'm still looking on their site as they were trying to charge me $150. The website is poorly done and very confusing. I went to Delta checked bags under Delta Airlines and I'm still trying to find it. The customer service was rude and unhelpful when I asked for a supervisor to come and assist. When I explained that his website was not very good at telling me what the baggage fee was he walked away.

I sprinted through the airport to arrive 3 minutes short. The answer from the sarcastic Delta representative - they may be able to place me on standby for a flight leaving in a few hours, but I should probably start checking out hotels. Nice! I am disappointed with their poor logistical planning and lack of professionalism. To top matters off, my suitcase was damaged.

Only solution offered by Delta was flight leaving Las Vegas at 3:45 p.m. and arriving in Greensboro at 12:45 a.m. on 21 Nov instead of flying into Raleigh. There was an earlier flight leaving Las Vegas and arriving in Greensboro but it was full. One passenger offered to give up his seat if Delta would pay for hotel accommodations that night but Delta would not pay for the hotel. My car was at the Raleigh Airport. Had to make arrangements for someone to pick me up in Greensboro at 12:45 a.m. on a Sunday night and drive 1.5 hours to Raleigh airport where my car was. Then still had to drive home in Raleigh and get up to leave for work by 6:30 a.m. No other options were offered to me by Delta. This return trip was horrible and completely unacceptable.

Delta Air Lines,8,Rajan Parrikar,12th December 2016,"✅ Verified Review | San Francisco to Atlanta in First Class on a B737-900ER. Delta provides its domestic First Class passengers with premium lane privileges at security but not the use of its lounge. The aircraft was quite new and the cabin was in good condition. Seats had enough width but limited incline, as is the norm on most US domestic carriers. Each seat was fitted with an interactive monitor that was responsive and state-of-the-art. On-board service was friendly and efficient, and the food served better than average. The in-flight wifi service through gogo was $33 for the duration of the flight, which is ridiculous, but I still bought it. The lavatory was unusually small and given that this pane was just 2.6 years old, I wonder why they had to make it this uncomfortable.

It was my first time flying Delta and I and the rest of my family were positively surprised. Beginning from the ground service to the cabin I was impressed, the only thing I could say is that they could do with slightly better seats in economy class. Another thing I would like to point out is the ground service - lost and found items and damaged luggage. Unfortunately it happened to me that we lost important documents and my luggage was damaged. Delta contacted me right after we landed informing us that they found our documents and money.

Delta rescheduled me for next day flight but my trip was already ruined due to the delay. Delta stated in MSP that the delay was due to weather which was not true so that they do not have to refund me. Another Delta passenger had the same experience as me who was from a different city. They made me pay for the hotel overnight. I also cancelled the whole trip but they could not tell me even approximate of how much credit I received for cacelling rest of the trip.

Great friendly efficient staff on the ground and inflight. The overhead bins are the largest i've ever seen and for the first time ever in Hawaii the priority tagged luggage arrived first and in record time. In addition, the Kona ground staff were at luggage claim offering bottled water. Here's the bizarre twist. The first class meal offered was a cold processed sandwich with 3 slices of apple and a Saran wrapped cookie. The wonderful cabin crew was embarrassed and had no idea or explanation. I have flown this flight at least 20 times in the last few years and a hot meal was always offered. This is a 5 hour flight with a 5pm departure in a first class cabin. In addition for a while now Delta has been the only carrier offering wi-Fi between the mainland and Hawaii. Although the aircraft was equipped the service was not available.

Delta Air Lines,8,L Choi,7th November 2016,"✅ Verified Review | Our family of four flew from Toronto to Philadelphia via Detroit in Nov 2016, and back again on the same segments. I believe it is the first time we've flown Delta, and we were impressed despite a few hiccups: In general the staff were professional and personable, there seemed to be a real priority on leaving/arriving on time, ground services were able to move passengers onto the plane in good time despite the challenges. Appreciated the free onboard movies and being able to download the gogo app real-time to play the movie, did not use Wi-Fi for Internet access. We got a super deal for this fare. Toronto to Detroit a smaller plane - we were all seated apart from each other, which was not optimal but we knew check-in seat assignment was a condition of the fare we purchased (just didn't realize it could be at the gate) - apparently our names were called at the gate but we did not hear the announcement, and by the time we got to the desk, these were the best seats we could get - one of my children is 10 years old, so I think the system should aim to seat a parent with a child that age or younger - seat assignments at the gate are a bit frustrating, you're in 1 line with a mix of customer issues which take a little to a lot of time to resolve - I stood in line for about 15 minutes only to be told that I would have to wait until my name was called - I was seated in a window seat, in row of two seats. When an obese passenger sat down beside me, I felt very squished (the passenger took ~ 1.5 seats) and I knew (being somewhat claustrophobic) that flying for an hour would not be a tolerable situation - I requested and was granted a seat change to a spare seat so that issue was resolved. However, I think Delta should have given this passenger two seats, it was unfair for both of us, and I'm not sure how the issue would have been resolved had there not been a spare empty seat. - flight was smooth and on time - we were very impressed Detroit to Philly - larger plane, we were able to check-in online and get these seat assignments then, we were all seated together, flight was on time - the landing was a bit hard. Return from Philly to Detroit we were unable to check-in online for some reason, and the error message said we should speak with a Special Services agent at the airport for check-in. It was strange, unlike the online check-in process Toronto-Philly, where I was able to check all four of us in, this time the system separated the two adults, and each child into a separate party - ie. we received three email notifications to check-in separately (which didn't work and we could not check-in online) - we had to speak with a Special Services agent, who was able to seat two of us together (adjacent aisle seats) and the other two in separate areas of the plane. Flight was smooth and on time, they were overbooked (probably due to the previous flight issue) but this issue was resolved. Detroit to Toronto there wasn't enough room to accommodate everyone at the gate area (I believe a previous flight had been cancelled) -the gate was small, seemed more like a hallway. The agent in Philly was able to seat 3 of us, we had to get 1 seat assigned at the gate - flight was delayed because there was a problem closing the cargo door - other than that the flight was smooth, great landing.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to PHL via DTW,November 2016,4,4,3,5,4,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,Pascal Pierre Saunier,3rd November 2016,"I fly the Europe-Chicago route once to twice a year. I often fly AF-KLM and Delta was a very good surprise! I flew Delta on 23 October and my seat was 29F. Check in was fast since I was connecting in Amsterdam from a flight from Brussels. The aircraft was a 767 in a 2-3-2 layout. The pitch was average in the 31-32 inches and seats ok for economy. What came as a very good surprise was the meal and beverage service. We had a choice of 3 different dinners (one being vegetarian) and they came with an entrée, salad, cheese and dessert. We had a mid-flight snack in a small box and a pre-arrival sandwich. We also had ice cream. Beverages were served often and each was given a bottle of water. Coffee was good and wine and beer was complimentary. I beleive this was of my best economy class flights ever, better than Air France for sure. On the outbound flight, I had seat 10c on the Detroit-Amsterdam in an A330. Great legroom and worth the money. The ticket cost me €460 return and that inlcudes Comfort class from DTW to Amsterdam @ €89 one way.

Get called up to the front desk, turns out they overbooked the flight and I was the lucky overbooked passenger. So, my boyfriend and I agreed to get on a different flight to Seattle, which would get us to Sacramento an hour later than we intended (which isn't too bad). We land in Seattle and they change gates in a different terminal right before the flight. We rush over, plane is delayed an hour. Get on the plane, they inform us of an engine leak. Fix that, say we are on our way. About 40 minutes later, we all get back off the plane. To end this quickly, we are still in Seattle but now waiting for our flight to Calgary. As university students, going on short trips is something you save for. I lost not only a planned weekend (hotels etc) but an entire day at an airport we were never supposed to be at.

I get to the Delta terminal at LA after a somewhat 11-hour flight, the self-check-in was easy and the staff were helpful, I dropped the baggage, the lady serving the counter was really helpful and the baggage drop itself was efficient. I went through TSA and into the terminal. The Delta terminal at LA would be an insult to 3rd world airports because there is absolutely nothing going on there. Unlike the competing American carrier's terminal where there is always music playing and all duty-free on one side, and all planes on the other so passengers can watch planes come and go, it kind of already made me hate the airline. The boarding was pretty efficient, and the cabin crew was the highlight of the experience. This was a red eye flight, and despite that the FA's kept making rounds of the cabin offering water, drinks, and snacks. In addition to that, they went out of their way to shuffle baggage in the cabin to make space without having to check them in. The flight on the plus side arrived 45 minutes early and I couldn't have been happier. The seat was really uncomfortable, and IFE was decent, but you have to press really hard to get it to respond.

Well we flew out early at 11.24am! Then we got to Atlanta and all went to hell. Delta offered us 1 seat (split us up) on the next early flight not 2 (1 for each of us) so we asked if there was any other way and they said nope, nothing we can do. I asked about our checked bags and was told they would stay here until we depart at 9.20pm, 8.5 hours after landing.

Now for the flight out of Minneapolis on the CRJ, the overhead couldn't hold a carry on bag with wheels. Unbelievably tiny, the seats were in good condition, but I was so unconfortable. They should retire these planes or make the overhead bins larger because my carry on fits in every overhead. When we arrived in Rapid city, our bag was the first to come out.

Because of this failure I missed work, so I missed a paycheck and I eventually bought an Alaska Airlines ticket to ensure I would make it home. I get that mistakes happen but in Atlanta where my biggest delay was we were repeatedly mislead by the staff. 20 min delays turned into 2 hour delays but every 30 mins someone would tell us it was almost boarding time. At least be honest about the situation. Then when the crowd would get understandably frustrated one fellow reminded us all that is was a ""long day for them"" and ""they were all tired too"" - excuse me? You are getting paid right now to do you job. I am losing money by the minute while you are just a half hour away from your house. Just horrible customer service. I got 2 vouchers for $200 each was great. Fortunately these vouchers will allow me to attend my friend's wedding in Jamaica. However, I come to find out after weeks of planning that I can't apply both vouchers for one trip. That's a huge let down as suddenly a ticket I thought would cost me $200 will now cost me $400. I call customer service thinking this will all get cleared up. Wrong. They inform me that they can only apply both vouchers if they honor a new ticket fee of $800 - so what good is the extra $200 off if you then raise the prices?

The ground and inflight staff were competent, efficient and a pleasure to deal with, which is my usual experience with Delta personnel. I am not a foodie, but I was not impressed with the catering. Perhaps too high expectations, given all the hype about celebrity chefs and the fancy menu. The first courses (starters, soups, salads) were great, the entrees were barely OK. Likewise the desserts.

ATL is a major Delta hub, so how they don't have an extra plane in case of an emergency?! Also the fact that we were kept 3.5 hours on termac was awful! It is inhuman to keep people on the plane while trying to fix it. The fumes that eventually leaked from flooded engine were suffocating us, all while we were told to hang on tight and wait until they figure out if the pump works. I know I do not spend time in my car while mechanic is working on it, so why the passengers had to stay on the plane while having mechanical issues. By far this was my worst experience flying, and I travel a lot. Overall I am greatly disappointed with how Delta handles its business when planes are facing mechanical issues.

The flight attendants did everything to comfort her and help her in any way possible. The passenger sitting in front of her ( next to me) spoke rudely and disrepectfully about the poor lady having the panick attack only adding to the situation. The flight attendants asked politely for the women in front to move her seat forward in exchange for complimentary drinks the rest of the flight. To help the women feel more comfortable having the panic attack. The lady flat refused loudly and rudely. During all of this. As if they didnt have their hands full they had 3 different people who repetitively pressed the assistance button to demand alcholic beverages. One group pressed the button non stop for 5 minutes until they where helped. The flight attendant apologized and made them aware of the situation. So I applaud the flight attendants on this flight.

Copious amounts of delicious food presented in an elegant way. Great red wine. Wonderful service. Add to that the great onboard free streamed entertainment system titled Online Delta Studio, which you can access on any of your devices, and an internet connection that actually works. I'm so impressed with Delta right now for this is an airline I despised, and rightfully so, for having some of the worse onboard experiences.

We got to airport at 3:30 a.m. only to find out our flight said it was delayed until 10:00 a.m. Called 1-800 number right away, was on hold for 25 minutes. We asked if they could rebook us on another flight that morning. After looking things over our flight was actually showing decommissioned and no other flights scheduled to replace. They tried to see if any other flights available and then asked if anyone was at the Delta counter and told me to talk to them. I hung up and went to Delta counter and basically they couldn't explain to me why this happened but stated they could see if there were any other fights available. They kept asking me if there were still 4 of us flying, I said yes this is our family vacation so all 4 of us were going to Mexico. There were no flights available but they could possibly get 3 of us out that day and the other person out the next day. I told her that would not work, so the only other other option was to leave the next day. I politely said I knew this wasn't their fault but wanted to know why Delta would cancel the flight without making other accommodations for the passengers whose flight schedules were now messed up. I was handed a Delta card with the 1-800 number and told me to call them. I indicated I already did. This was a huge ordeal as I felt Delta was of no help for something they created. Long story short, in order to fly out that day I had to purchase additional tickets with American Airlines. I went back to the Delta counter spoke and said I was able to get tickets with American and wanted to cancel the ones just booked. She said that was fine but that would also cancel our return flight. I indicated that was unfair as the flight going to was the only one affected, but was told this wasn't how it worked. I had to call the 800 # with my travel agent and tell the story again to find out if I purchased the tickets with American if I could keep my return tickets with Delta. She said yes I should since this was Delta's fault, she told me to go to the Delta counter and let them know. I told her they were not helpful and basically told me no. She placed me on hold came back and stated she got a hold of Delta and all was confirmed, return flight was still valid and cancelled only tickets going out.

Delta Air Lines,2,Molly Kalamarided,12th August 2016,"Flew from Anchorage to San Francisco via Seattle. I am becoming increasingly disappointed with Delta Air Lines, and the travel process in general. 1) Customers should be asked for their height and weight/whether they will physically observe more than one seat, upon purchasing a ticket. As an American female of average or under average height/weight, each time I am seated next to a large person it frustrates me that I am increasingly limited into an already insufficient space. I try my best to be tolerant but it frustrates me that I am paying the same amount of money to have someone's body mass spill over and occupy a portion of my seat. It's uncomfortable for me and embarrassing for them. Either make them buy two regular seats or one first class seat. 2) I understand the temperature of the plane has a purpose, but when I am still too cold/uncomfortable when wearing two sweatshirts, a jacket, jeans and a blanket, you need to turn the heat up a little. 3) Stop overbooking your flights. People aren't paying to get bumped out of their seats. 4) My flight today was delayed 4 hours and I am missing one of the events that I specifically purchased this ticket for. I was also told there was no way to get on an earlier flight. This is ridiculous. In all my years of flying, I have never had such an issue on any other airline.

Delta Air Lines,1,R Johnson,10th August 2016,"✅ Verified Review | The new interior cabin updates seem to ""look"" nice, however, it is clear that whoever designed this has never worked on an aircraft. The lavatories walls are so narrow it would be very difficult for anyone over 190 lbs to manoeuvre freely. Not only are the lavatories almost half the size, the space has cut into the galley so that now you feel terrible standing in the way of flight attendants with no where to stand that is not inhibiting either other passengers or the attendants. The staff were warm and friendly, but they too confessed these updates were difficult for them becuase they can no longer even see when passengers request assistance or have questions from their seats. The call lights are too low on the overhead space for attendants to see and there has been zero adjustment on leg space and comfort for passengers. In addition there was no inflight entertainment on a 5 hour flight. After this terrible experience, I have now been struggling to return home to Los Angeles from my work trip to Louisville, due to Delta's system crashing, their apparent logical response to the thousands of passengers stranded is to prolong and cancel even more flights putting the issue off. At some point all these people are going to have to fly home, cancelling more flights due to overcrowded scheduling is actually making the problem worse. While I have time to afford not going back to work immediately (since I haven't been able to get home yet and this is now the third flight I've finally been able to snag a seat) there were dozens of military at ticketing with no flight options out so that they could arrive and report for duty and training.

No offers were made at all to make any passenger feel better about their service, just a rebooking. Today travel was going smoother, I had a two hour planned delay and I asked a Delta rep if they could put me on a near empty flight that had seating available and left an hour earlier. I didn't even have a checked bag. I was treated rudely by Delta staff and told it was a $50 up charge even though I had no baggage and I explained my previous poor experience. You would think they would want to help a little at no cost to them. The Delta staff didn't care and didn't even offer to attempt to ask anyone what could be done. I'm not a rude passenger, just hoping they would help me out to have a better experience this time. I own a small business and I think it's a shame when a company becomes so large that common sense and courtesy to customers cannot prevail. I would be appalled if my employee treated my customer this way.

Flight information indicated an LA arrival of 10:20 pm, versus the originally booked ETA of 9:50 pm. No big deal. But, the way they staff handled boarding was so disorganized that we left much later than the (already delayed) ETD of 7:40 pm. It was like herding cats with many people being left with no overhead storage space. I was fortunate to have boarded with zone 2, but it was incredible how many carry bags and back packs that could easily fit under the seat in front of passengers wound up in the overhead. Thus, quite a long delay doing last second checking of bags. The pilot made up time and it was proudly announced we had landed in LA at 10:04 pm, roughly 10 minutes later than the original schedule. But, then we sat on the runway for two hours before finding a gate at the Tom Bradley International terminal. So, it appears our flight was sacrificed to avoid backing up other flights. We exited into the terminal (after midnight) to find (literally) wall-to-wall people waiting on flights. A serious mess. Then the long walk with our bags to get to a domestic terminal to pick-up our shuttle. When we were getting ready to exit the plane, the pilot came over the PA with a less than sincere, meaningless apology. This airline is horrible!

I'm pretty sure they ovebooked that flight and gave away our seats or sold them. It was 15 of us about 3 or 4 families with children and old people but they didnt care.They treated us like animals and called security on us when we asked to talk to the person in charge. Then they told us very dryly to go to the help desk where actually nobody was actually help you. They just gave you a phone number and let you solve your own problem so I was forced to stay on the phone for over one hour to try to rebook my flight and repair their mistake. I had to spent one night in Minneapolis and the next day they flew us to Salt Lake City where I had to spend 8 hours in the airport; the flight to Europe was delayed again 3.5 hours so by the time I arrived in Europe I missed my connection again so they rebooked me on a flight to Paris from Amsterdam. That plane too left one hour later than scheduled and my final plane had another hour delay to my final destination to Bucharest. All in all I had to change 5 planes and it took me 2 days and 4 hours to get to Bucharest from Las Vegas traveling with 3 minor children and a 72 years old. This is by far the worst airline I ever had to deal with and I will never fly Delta again. They were extremely rude and unhelpful, didn't care that it was their fault; they would lie to our faces that they are aware of our delay and we were already rebooked on a different flight. I had to do everything myself and run around in 5 different airports with children and luggage.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LAS to OTP via MSP / SLC / AMS / CDG,July 2016,1,1,1,4,1,1,no

Drinks were served 4 times and we were served food 3 times. The cabin staff were more mature and I always find they are a little more professional. A smooth on time arrival and we waited 3 hrs for our connection to Orlando. For the second flight we flew on a brand new A321 aircraft, the captain telling everyone it was the second day in service. The seats were very comfortable in Economy class and even when the person in front reclines you lose very little space with the way these new seats recline. The flight was only 85 minutes and it was turbulent for most of the flight which caused the staff to stop serving drinks before getting to us. No big deal and we landed safely in Orlando MCO for a 25 day holiday.

Show up following day and flight is delayed for 4 hours.

Delta Air Lines,1,Tu Nguyen,28th July 2016,"✅ Verified Review | Las Vegas to Los Angeles. We arrived at McCarran International Airport almost two hours prior to the scheduled departure time. My party had already checked-in online so we printed our boarding passes at the self-serve kiosks, and then dropped off our checked luggage. Once that was complete, we went through TSA/airport security, where the problem arose. There were eight people on our booking, however two of the boarding passes had not printed correctly, with the barcodes only printing halfway. As such, the boarding pass was unable to be scanned, and we were told to print out new boarding passes. We ran back down to the ticketing counter, had our boarding passes reprinted by an actual employee of Delta Airlines (not at the kiosk), and went back to TSA, only to find that this new boarding pass would not scan either. Again, we had our boarding passes reprinted once more, and again, it would not scan. The TSA officer stated that the issue was that there was no “destination” stated on the new boarding passes. We then had to go back downstairs to the ticketing counter, retrieve our original boarding pass with the faulty barcode, and bring them all back up to TSA. Only then were we allowed to pass through airport security. We reached the gate 4 minutes late, and were not allowed to board, even though the cabin doors had not been closed. During this time, our friends who had successfully passed airport security had been explaining to Delta Airlines employees at the gate, however they received no help from them. The Delta employee at the gate stated that all he could do was put us on a waiting list on the next Delta Airlines flight, which was already full, and that we should contact other airlines for a new flight. What was even more frustrating is that there was a delay, and the plane did not leave the gate for a further 20 minutes!

I tried to call reservations multiple times over the past week. I had delays of 40 min to 2+ hours. Most time I could not get through. The space under the seats in the First/Business Class cabin on the B737-900 ER has been severely reduced. I do not know about the economy section. There are 3 black boxes under the seat and a 120 V plug. This makes it impossible to store anything under the seat ahead of an aisle seat. The space has been reduced in the right to left dimension and in the top to bottom dimension. In addition, the Boeing seat struts are poorly designed so that there is little space for the aisle seat under the seat ahead & there is dead useless space. In effect the under-seat space is divided into 3 compartments for the aisle seat. The 1st photo shows from right to left: the bar by the aisle, 1st black box, metal seat strut, 2nd black box.

After several terrible experiences that I personally had made in the past my family now got to experience the extremely poor customer service of this airline and its total disregard of its customers. My family came to visit me in CO from Europe, travelling Munich to Denver via Atlanta. After massive delay they arrived in Denver with 2 bags missing. We were assured the bags will arrive at my address the next afternoon. We had plans for that day and couldn't do anything but wait for the bag delivery. The bags finally arrived at midnight. One bag was severely damaged the other one completely destroyed. The pieces of the bag and its damaged and broken content were delivered in a plastic bag with a handwritten note that the bag was run over by a truck. We filed a claim with Delta online and received a confirmation email that they received our claim. After two weeks of no further emails from Delta we called several times to be updated on our case and how to proceed. Very poor customer service, extremely unorganized.

Whisked through security with a minimum of fuss and went upstairs to the lounge. That was modern and spacious with enough variety in the beers, spirits and wines. Lounge had shower facilities, Wifi was very fast. However, the food on offer is far below what is available in the lounges in the TBIT. Boarded about 20 minutes late then sat for an eternity before takeoff. Left LAX an hour late which we did not catch up on the 14 hour flight which was probably due to head winds. Meal after takeoff was poor so I left it and went to sleep. Lie flat beds are ok, if a little narrow. Pyjamas, two pillows and a great duna provided me with the creature comforts and enabled me to sleep for ten hours. I had seat 9A which was tucked away in the back of the first section. It seemed to be more private than the other seats. As mentioned in my earlier review, I am not a fan of the reverse herringbone layout.

We asked about hotel and meal vouchers through a Delta representative and got none, we were told that they did not do that unless it was Delta's fault because it ""wasn't their fault"" and was claiming it was air traffic control's fault. After being up for 24 hours that was not the answer we wanted to hear. We were compensated at Heathrow by Virgin Atlantic with a more than fair amount for food vouchers just for a little delay.

Delta Air Lines,2,O Carter,11th July 2016,"✅ Verified Review | San Diego to Providence via Atlanta with Delta. We were traveling as a family to attend our son's graduation. We booked our trip in First Class as we consider coast to coast a long haul flight, and we like our comfort. Firstly, 4/4 flights were delayed. Delays due to weather, to not having a gate ready to disembark passengers, to long lines waiting to take off, to a faulty fuel cap, to missing paperwork, to delayed arrival of connecting aircraft, etc. Second, the seats in first class are hard as rocks, as well as cramped and narrow with insufficient recline. United gets the edge on this amenity, hands down. On the 4 aircraft we flew on, only two had entertainment systems. Only one of those two worked. On the other two aircraft, you may use your own device to access their new ""Delta Studio"", which offers ""free"" entertainment. However, the only entertainment value in Delta Studio is trying, and consistently failing, to get it to function. The icing on the cake of our tedious journey was on the final leg home. Our flight from Providence to Atlanta was delayed 2 hours, then rerouted off the Eastern Seaboard to a far western track south, causing more delay, bringing us in to Atlanta about 15 minutes before the scheduled departure of our last leg home. At the arriving gate, someone told us that if we sprinted, we just might make our flight, which at that point was listed as on time. We actually managed to get to our departure gate at about 10:30, which was scheduled departure. The genesis of the problems we encountered from here on began when we optimistically assumed that the gate agent at our delayed arrival gate had notified the departing gate that their 3 missing passengers were on their way. Alas, he did not. Gate agent at departing gate tells us that he reassigned 1 of our 3 first class seats to someone else, since we ""failed"" to make our flight, and that the only option left was a standby seat left in the middle seat of economy. So, my husband's seat was reassigned during our sprint to the gate and he gets downgraded. We asked if we would receive compensation for the downgrade. We asked if at least my husband could expect premium service in his new seat assignment. We asked if we could be rebooked on the next flight. Staff replies with chapter/verse about ""procedures"". My husband crams in to his middle economy seat, my son and I up in First, when a few minutes later, captain says flight was delayed due to fuel and paperwork.",,Couple Leisure,First Class,SAN to PVD via ATL,July 2016,2,1,3,1,1,3,no
Delta Air Lines,9,M Tonelli,10th July 2016,"Delta in my opinion, is the best american airline to fly transatlantic flights. Had a very cheap ticket for my vacation to Italy. On the first leg, I was seated in the very last row, and there was no window where I was sitting. The plane was very full, so I was not moved. The crew were nice and gave me extra snacks and drinks and apologized for the bad seat. The seats were rather uncomfortable, but they were tolerable for the flight time. Best part about the first leg was the IFE. Delta has free streaming from your device, so I was occupied during my entire flight. At JFK, we had a very short connection, of only 51 minutes, but the previous flight arrived 20 minutes early and the international flight left 20 minutes late, so we had plenty of time. Delta terminal at JFK, terminal 4, is nothing special, and lacks food options. The last leg, going to Pisa, was very good. The 757-200 is very good to fly transatlantic routes, and it had a new interior with mood lighting, IFE, and extremely comfortable seats. The touchscreen were very fast and responsive, with plenty of movies and other options. Dinner and drinks came out right away, and the options, the classic chicken or pasta, of which I chose chicken, was very good. Plenty of food and drinks to keep me satisfied throughout the 7 hour flight. I slept for 4 hours, which is a lot for me, I usually don't sleep on planes, but the seats were extremely comfortable. All the seats had USB and AC power, so I kept all my devices charged and ready for taking pictures.

For this amount you expect a good service, tasty food, friendly staff and up to standard infotainment and comfy seats. You might feel this coming but unfortunately its none of the above. The service is the part which is most disappointing: its unfriendly, after dinner they disappear and its really up to you to get any drink or food or about 3-4 hour when they appear again to get ready for landing.

While far from perfect, they are the better of the legacy US carriers. On the positive side they seem to be pretty consistently on time, or close enough. I've had tight connections in hubs and never a problem, even though I've had to sprint on occasion. SLC is best, then MSP, DTW. ATL is spotty, LAX is definitely a problem spot. The cabin crew is far, far better on the whole than United. Much more professional and caring, usually well put together. While it's impossible to use miles (like all carriers it seems), they offer decent perks for status. On the negative side, they change their schedule all the time. Like, weekly, but tend to firm up about 10 days out (so more planning than execution).

Delta Air Lines,8,L Barallat,2nd July 2016,"Travelled recently on Delta to Paris CDG, opting for the EWR flight as the time was more convenient than the earlier departure from JFK (I was using Delta Sky Miles for this segment). The Delta ""rotunda"" at EWR is actually a near-pleasant experience. For one, the departure time, just after 9pm, means its the last Delta departure out of EWR for the day and the entire security experience to gate was hassle free. The Amsterdam flight departs much earlier, at 6.30pm. The boarding area is standard Delta fare. There is a small Duty Free shop, some relatively tidy bathrooms, and one sports bar in the long corridor that leads to the gates. Boarding was chaotic (flight was full) and plenty of additional passport checks were conducted at the gate. Flight push back was delayed 35-40 minutes due to a Sofia bound passenger that didn't board, and the luggage had to be removed from the hold. The plane was a 1991-build 767-300ER, which once flew for Gulf Air. Delta has done a nice job of renovating the interiors and even Economy Class was decent. AVOD was great as was the USB port to charge your phone. Meal service was nothing spectacular, but did the job for what is a 6 hour 30 minute flight. Cabin crew were efficient, relatively friendly.

I am the most understanding and peaceful person I know, but I'm so upset right now that I'm posting this review right before we take off. Everything was fine until I started to board, and then right as I was about to scan my boarding pass, an employee grabs a tag and puts it on my carry on bag and says, 'all bags with wheels have to check'. I told him calmly that I don't want to check my bag because I don't have any checked bags. He forces the tag into my hand and says plane is full. So I walk down and leave my bag. I was a little upset, but despite his terrible communication and people skills, if it's full, it's full. So I board the plane and go near my seat and sure enough, there's at least three or four places where my bag would easily fit. I tell a flight attendant right away and they tell me that the checked bags have already been stored underneath, so I can't go get it. Why would he say that?

Delta Air Lines,9,J Krinsky,27th June 2016,Excellent and friendly service by the gate agent and flight attendants. My wife and I were greeted by name by the gate agent as we boarded. The FAs called us by name and constantly walked around to see if we needed anything. I would rate the food as above average. The fight departed Atlanta and landed on-time in Salt Lake City. Our luggage was delivered timely. The pilots kept the passengers informed during the flight.

Potato chip crumbs on my seat, oily screen, urine all over floor/toilet in bathroom which leads me to believe the plane was never kept or cleaned before our boarding. At 11.43am we were still on the tarmac and they said that something mechanical was wrong with the plane. We then returned to the gate. It is now 1.36pm and we have reboarded the plane. We still have not left. They are saying that they still have no further information. On top of that, the crew have asked us to have sympathy for them. Delta is laughable. I don't have sympathy for the crew.

Delta Air Lines,2,R Caws,23rd June 2016,"✅ Verified Review | Extremely unhappy with Delta. I had a so-so experience during a flight to Little Rock on a Delta partner a few years ago. This time around we flew into DCA. Upon departing D.C., we were delayed by inclement weather to a connection in Atlanta. Even though we selected an alternative flight upon self check-in, we received passes for the cancelled flight. Going to customer service was futile, the desk clerk literally told her supervisor she would not handle delayed flight cases. We got rebooked to a connection in Minneapolis, which Delta also cancelled. It took a further 2 hours waiting in a customer service line to get a solution. The customer service personnel proved absolutely useless, actually handing us a card to their 800 line because they were overwhelmed. The call also proved frustrating, it was only after thirty minutes of being put on hold and talking to an agent that we managed to get a connection to JFK the following morning. On other notes, Delta doesn't offer a free checked bag like many airlines. To check one bag is $25. The food on the flight to LAX was overpriced generic junk, think $12 for a wrap you could have bought for $5 at 7-11.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DCA to LAX,June 2016,2,2,2,1,1,1,no
Delta Air Lines,9,Kevin Tunnicliffe,21st June 2016,"✅ Verified Review | Denver to Manchester via New York JFK. Delta offer no lounge facility at Denver and nor do they offer any vouchers or other compensation for this - Not good enough. The airline brags a lot about its ability to stick to schedule and pulls one or two tricks to achieve this. We pulled back from the gate within a couple of minutes of schedule but then sat around for an age prior to taxiing. On time departure is calculated from pull back from gate, even if you go only a few feet. Service on board both sectors was excellent with very pleasant and efficient crew. Food offerings on both flights were very good and beverages were frequently offered. Denver to JFK was a midday flight and JFK to Manchester an overnight. Service on both flights was excellent. The lounge at JFK was welcoming and had a variety of hot and cold food on offer. Having eaten on the plane we did not bother with the offerings in the lounge. There is a complimentary bar service (you pay for premium and imported) with a good range of beverages supplemented by tea/coffee machines. The flat bed on both sectors was comfortable, IFE has a small selection compared to many airlines, not a problem for the overnight flight as I slept most of the trip. Bags were on the belt quickly in Manchester. Overall a good experience but Delta need to get lounge access at Denver.",,Couple Leisure,Business Class,DEN to MAN via JFK,June 2016,5,5,5,2,5,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,2,Stephen Blaskowski,17th June 2016,"I just spent 12 hours on airplanes and in airports traveling from DCA to SFO and very few of them were pleasant. It started with a delayed flight that would have caused me to miss my connecting flight. I did receive email notice, but the itinerary was not rebooked. I went to do it myself but was unsure whether or not I could make the earlier flight and so I decided to wait to resolve the issue at the airport customer service desk. Apparently that was my fatal mistake. I arrived at the airport a good hour before the earlier flight's scheduled departure and proceeded to stand in line for half an hour at the desk while 1 customer service rep was struggling to manage a growing line. By the time the other representatives who had been walking in and out of the back room finally jumped in to help, I had tried and failed to rebook myself both online and on the phone, where the estimated wait time was 34 minutes. The representative rebooked me on the remaining itinerary available which was several hours later. After security I then stood in another customer service line for nearly an hour to receive my seat assignment. This flight was also significantly delayed, and even after boarding, we then sat on the tarmac for another hour because of first ""congestion on the runway"" and then ""inclement weather"". I also was asked to check my carry on due to space limitations, and when I protested explaining that I had an interview the next morning and my suit was in my carry on and I didn't want to risk the luggage being lost, the representative literally pulled my ticket out of my shirt pocket to check my name. We were all frazzled, but this really took me aback. By an act of God, my new layover was several hours and the gate happened to be right next to our arrival gate so I made the connection despite the two hour delay (on top of the delay from my original booking). This second flight was also slightly delayed and again I was asked to check my carry on. This time I relented after the representative offered that I remove my garment bag and she would hang it in first class. This rep is the only reason I'm giving a rating above the absolute minimum. Once we arrived in SFO the cherry on top is that we were forced to sit on the tarmac for another half an hour waiting for the arrival gate to open up. I'm not trying to be petty. I'm just legitimately frustrated and exhausted. Customers pay a lot of money for these flights. They don't have to be this painful and they shouldn't be.

Delta Air Lines,1,Ron Hoffman,12th June 2016,"This review is for an upcoming flight from Halifax to LAX via Boston. Since we booked the flight, Delta has changed the flight information 3 times, including cancelling 2 flights. The last straw was that after purchasing a ticket from Halifax to Boston in order to catch a flight on Delta from Boston to Los Angeles, this flight was also cancelled and we were asked to wait over 5 hours in Boston to catch a later flight. The Delta agent I talked to had no clue as to why the flight had been cancelled. Delta is the worst as far as reliable flights. The date is actually Oct 21, 2016 but the form would not allow future dates (this is about ticketing and flight cancellations in for a future flight - it can only get worse).",,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,BOS to LAX,June 2016,1,1,,,1,1,no

Delta Air Lines,9,Marius Henkel,10th June 2016,"Delta Air Lines from Munich to Atlanta on an old Boeing 767-400ER, flight time 9:50. Pre-Boarding in MUC I was surprised by the captain stepping outside the plane and anouncing the flight infront of the whole B-Gates. Crew was nice and welcoming. I preordered veggie food and tasted like it was bought at a Wholefoods market. I have seen better Entertainment Systems with a wider selection of movies and TV shows, but it worked out fine for me and was easy to use. Atlanta serves as the biggest Delta Hub and makes it quite easy to transfer. It is the busiest airport in the world, though, so short connections are usually not reached. ATL to CVG was on a MD88, not the newest aircraft but clean and on time. It was full, so some passengers were offered to check their bags during boarding for free. Onboard service like any other domestic airline, but onboard WiFi seemed to have worked good. When I came to the baggage claim at CVG, my bags were already there, waiting for me. My flight back to MUC was from PHL on the new connection via DTW. Flight from PHL to DTW was on a Boeing 717-200 and delayed by 2 hours due to heavy thunderstorms in PHL and temporary airport closure during that time. Not Deltas fault and they seemed to do everything they could to rebook passengers with tight connections at DTW. Aircraft used was small and again packed full. Again basic service. DTW serves as Deltas second largest hub and is easy to get around since domestic and international Gates from Delta and partners are just across the hall. DTW-MUC again on an old B767-400ER, but with flawless service and nice selection of beers and wines even in Economy Basic. Also love the fact that the B767 has only two seats in the outer rows, which makes window seats even more attractive. Flight was only half full with plenty of room for sleeping. Flight time 8:20 hours with a landing 20 minutes earlier in Munich than scheduled. Based on the experience I will fly Delta to the US again, because DTW seems a good airport to enter US soil and connect to different cities.",Boeing 767-400 / MD88 / B717,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MUC to CVG via ATL,June 2016,5,4,5,4,5,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,2,D Lewis,8th June 2016,"✅ Verified Review | Delta Air Lines flight dreadful in every way. The all-economy-class CRJ200 should have been long retired. DL's (and other US carriers') continued use of this extremely uncomfortable relic on routes well over an hour long boggles the mind. The gate agent did not thank me in any way for being a gold elite frequent flyer in DL's program, and did not smile (the least she could do, given that there's no first class to upgrade into). My exit row seat (8D) had less legroom than regular non-exit rows on mainline aircraft. Extremely bumpy flight throughout. Bathroom at the back of the aircraft is incredibly tiny. My feet were freezing by the end of the one and a half hour long flight, because of the very cold airflow by the floor in the exit row (not sure if this was a specific issue with this particular A/C, or a problem with the CRJ200 in general). The pricing on this route does not make any sense (I paid as much for a coach one-way Detroit-Greensboro in coach as I do for roundtrip nonstops Detroit - Las Vegas in first class), lack of competition or high demand, perhaps.

Flew Detroit to Shanghai. The leather seats are pretty nice, as they feel less dirty than the fabric seats can potentially be. The inflight entertainment had a pretty good selection, but the setup of the system was not the most convenient. In the economy cabin, you plug your headphones into the system itself rather than the armrest, thus if you need to let a passenger leave his seat, you have to unplug your headphones for him to do so. The food in economy class was just what you would expect of airplane food, nothing special. When boarding the plane, the cabin was disgustingly heated, as the air conditioning was not working very well on the ground. The air conditioning did work while in the air, however.

This was the first time I have had such a bad experience flying. I was supposed to arrive home by Monday evening, but the flight was delayed by 1 hour due to mechanical failure so I would be missing my connection. I was rerouted to go home via a different airport, but that flight was also delayed by 2 hours due to weather. After standing in line for 45 minutes and spending 30 minutes on the phone, I was rescheduled for a flight out the following morning. Delta at least covered the accommodation, but I had to contact my work last minute. I thought the saga had ended when I arrived back at the airport the next morning. I was in for a surprise. I called the central help line to see if I could get my bag checked for free, since I had purchased liquid souvenirs after passing security the day before. The agent on the phone said they would maybe reimburse me, but thankfully noticed that my flight out that morning was delayed by 2 hours. She made a very deft, last minute move to rebook me for an earlier flight out through a different city and I had to run through security to make that flight. Having reached my layover city en route home a day later than expected, I thought, ""I'm finally on my way."" However, Delta had the wrong flight information posted at the gates. I was not aware of the mixup until my name was called over the intercom for the final boarding call. I rushed to the correct gate and barely made it onto the aircraft on time. I was very very upset at this point. I had to conclude that since I had never experienced this type of delay-after-delay-after-mistakes before flying with other airlines, that it must be something to do with Delta. I would not fly Delta ever again.

The second part, however, became a nightmare of pure frustration. We had a 3 hour lay-over in Atlanta and went directly to our gate to wait. We had been told that we would get a seat assigned once there. When the boarding agents arrived at the desk, we politely asked for a seating assignment. We were brusquely told to just sit down and watch the screens. Our name would appear with the seating assignment. We sat and waited - and waited. Not sure of what was happening. We waited until the clerk was finished boarding one group and didn't seem to be too busy. We again, politely asked how this system worked and were once again rudely told to sit down. Finally, when they were calling for last minute passengers we went to the desk again. This time we refused to sit down. Eventually they found us two seats, one at the back and the other in the middle of the plane. We were the last ones on. I had just settled when the boarding clerk came rushing on board and forced me to move to another seat. By this time I was in tears. It's not as if we booked this ticket as a last minute.

However, if you make the same flights all in the same day, you can use the Sky Club lounge. Now, even if the policy is inconsistent, you would hope the lounge staff could use some customer-friendly judgement and make an exception to let you in. No such luck at the DCA lounge. So much for goodwill. Sent an email to Delta customer service. We'll see if they are any better at dealing with customers.

Delta Air Lines,1,S Ritchie,16th April 2016,"✅ Verified Review | Flew from St Lucia - O'hare (Connecting flight in ATL). Only flew because the resort had an exclusive with them. Lost bag in ATL in the layover. They finally found it in ATL, and gave me the hours of 8:00am - 8:00pm to be delivered the following day. They would give me a call from an unknown number, but if I didn't answer, they wouldn't deliver it. Since I have a job and don't sit on my phone all day, my other option was for them to leave it at the front porch. I don't know about you, but I don't like my belongings just hanging around the front porch all day, so was I forced to take off work. I found Delta's customer service to be a joke when trying to get compensated for my lost wages. You call into one dept, with no managers, only to be told I have to put a complaint through their website. If you wish to follow up, you'll get the runaround. Once you put a complaint through their website, you'll get an email back from a general email stating, ""We don't offer reimbursement"", but thanks for paying $1500, along with the bag fees and inconvenience we caused you, but please fly again. You are unable to contact anyone via phone. Apparently, their corp center with the employees sending these emails, don't have phones. There's no phone lines to their Corp Center, so they can just hide behind general emails and deny people. 2nd time they lost my luggage.

We were split up, some put on standby and some not even on the system despite checking the bookings before starting to travel. At Boston the seats we originally booked could not be given to us as they were ""blocked"" for families. what are 2 grandparents, mother, father and seven year old twins? The seats allocated to us were 2 of the original at the side of the plane, 2 in the row behind the original, the mother moved to economy after being on standby and a seven year old girl to travel by herself.

I got booted from a seat that I'd booked over a month in advance for both legs of a trip from Minneapolis to Phoenix, and both times they moved me to the back of the plane (from the front/middle like I'd booked). I have both the Delta app and Tripcase, and Delta has my phone number and email on file.

For some unknown reason, Delta chose to put an aircraft with no power outlets and no USB connection on a 2500 mile route. The seats were hard and had limited recline. The meal service, when it finally came, was appalling. No nuts or pretzels were offered with drinks. The meal had no appetizer, no bread, the portions of the main course were tiny and unappetizing, and the dessert was some kind of nasty lemon gelatto that was half melted. The cabin crew was surly, indifferent, and hid behind the curtains in the galley for most of the flight. After several hours of no service, one water run was made before landing.

We are not young but even worse than that were the families with young children and the lack of compassion they are given.

The seatbelt sign was on for a while after take off but people were walking up and down and the staff didn't say anything to them. The exit area was blocked with litter but the staff did not make any attempt clear it away. The food was not worth eating, it was cold, dry and hard.

Then we sat on the plane for almost another hour when it was announced due to a fuel leak we would have to deplane and take another plane.

In fact they are comfortable with not a single member of our family sitting in the same row (despite having a saved seats together when the tickets were purchased 6 months in advance thru their website) instead they have seated our children separately 5 and 6 rows behind the closest parent and stated we are welcome to ask those around us if they are willing to trade for our newly assigned middle seats for the 6 hour flight, good luck.

I tried to explain that we had packed valuables into our had luggage and other items needed to complete our journey to Dublin. At this stage the staff became quite aggressive and told me to either check the bag or go back up to the gate. Again I tried to explain about we had packed all our valuables etc into the carry ones at which stage he told me I wasn't allowed to get on the flight and to go back to the gate. I had a connecting flight to catch once arriving in JFK so I had no choice to check in the carry ones with all the things inside them.

I spoke to the attendant when we boarded the plane and she said there was still plenty of room and they had not instructed the gate to do this.

The ticket booked was for San Diego to SLC on a Delta flight, and from SLC back to San Diego via SEATAC on a delta booked ticket on Alaska Airlines. On the way out, the flight was delayed on departure. No reason was given. On the way back, I ended up finishing early. I called Alaska to try to shift to an earlier flight. As expected, Alaska picked up in a couple of minutes. I attempted to utilize the Alaska Airlines same day ticketed change program to move to an earlier, direct flight back to San Diego, but the relationship with Delta made it so their system wouldn't process the change without cancelling my ticket and rebooking. They told me to call Delta. I called Delta, but was immediately put into the que. Rather than wait I opted to take the call back. It took them more than 30 minutes to call me back. Fail on customer service. When they did call me back, they first tried to charge me a $200 change fee on a government fare. This isn't allowed under their negotiated contract, but I had to argue with them to get them to realize this. If I hadn't known this, they would have tried to shove that down my throat. Then they told me that even without the fee, it was going to cost $200 + to change my ticket due to a difference in fare. Their excuse was that I didn't have a reservation when I had just given them a ticket number. At this point, the conversation ended due to a clear issue with them being able to do their job and me being unwilling to pay for something that would have been free had I booked my entire trip with Alaska airlines in the first place.

We also felt that as senior travelers, there might be some accommodation for our desire and need to be together. Our concerns were ignored. Now, we have learned that again, our seat assignment for the last leg of our flight home has been changed. We are particularly alarmed that not only was this done without being notified, but also, without any compensation whatsoever offered. Three separate complaints have been filed, all to no avail We have been told that all we are guaranteed is a seat and that our having chosen seats well in advance of our trip has no meaning, nor do they care whether we are senior travelers.

Had to queue for 45 mins and agent was unable to print my onward boarding card for flight from LAS to Gatwick though she printed my husband's. She said that this sometimes happened and didn't offer to try again. On reflection we decided this wasn't acceptable as we would have a short turnround time at Las Vegas but I didn't want to have to join the end of the special services queue again! Luckily managed to find a Delta employee this time who was extremely helpful and printed out the boarding card without any trouble.

The next morning while still in the air the pilot got word that the airport had not opened as planned so we had to land 4 hours away in the Liberia airport in Costa Rica. This would be a stressful situation for anyone in a foreign country without international calling to contact people back home. But instead of leaving us in Liberia until the ash cleared (which would've been like two days later) Delta helped make the situation easier by paying the fare for us to ride an air-conditioned charter bus all the way to our intended airport in San Juan.

No complaints whatsoever about the aircraft, check-in staff or onboard crew. In fact it was a pleasure to fly with Delta - the cabin crew on all flights were friendly, approachable and helpful. It is also nice to sit in business class seats which all face forwards. Entertainment system ok, great selection of films not so for the music.

After boarding our flight for Miami to Georgia and waiting for over 4 hours, it was announced that the plane would not take off. There were no apologies, no beverages offered and the customer service was anything other than available, let alone polite. Our luggage was lost and there was not one person in sight to help aid us.

I was stuck on the airport for 19 hrs - no one offers a hotel room and I did ask but no meals. It was caused by their own doing and they did not care.

Almost immediately got way too hot to the point where it felt suffocating. Then people complained and it turned very very cold to the point where people were bundled in jackets, blankets, whatever they could find. This was in business class. Overheard a flyer in the main cabin mention it was extremely hot. Flight crew said its been an issue with the aircraft they just haven't been able to figure out yet. For a short flight (under 3 hours) it seemed way longer. Just wanted to get off the plane asap. Delta staff were great but this plane needs to be looked at. Also no in seat entertainment which made the time feel like it was dragging on more. Overall bad experience on this flight but excellent on others with Delta.

Sat in 2D thus flight was worth the upgrade, no one sat next to me and the entertainment system was surprisingly updated with a great selection of movies.

Delta Air Lines,5,Charles Barnes,14th February 2016,"A mixed bag overall with Delta Air Lines. Seattle - Atlanta, volunteered to be bumped to a later flight for a $500 voucher and a first class upgrade. Flight turned out to be a Boeing 767 with the international business class seats - very comfy with a good cheeseburger and Sam Adams beer for lunch plus a very friendly attentive crew. AVOD had a wide selection of films but was slow to respond and developed sound problems during the second film. Mad dash through ATL from Concourse F to concourse A to catch my connecting flight. Got stuck in the middle seat in Economy Comfort to Norfolk but OK flight. Coming back there was snow in ORF so we were delayed 30 minutes for deicing. Relieved we got out at all. Atlanta - Seattle was a new 737-900. Despite being offered a free Economy Comfort upgrade outbound for some reason I would have to pay $89 for the return trip. Why? During boarding an announcement went through all overhead bin space was taken despite the fact there was clearly plenty of space in the rear third of the plane. This led to a number of understandably irate customers who were forced to check their bags. The economy class seat was cramped and very uncomfortable and the indifferent, rather surly crew (most likely ex-Northwest) didn't help matters. About the only thing free on the AVOD was live TV and the games. Fortunately we arrived on time meaning and end to a punishing experience returning home. I much prefer traveling Alaska or Southwest but this one was for business.","Boeing 767, A320, Boeing 737-900",Business,Economy Class,SEA-ORF via ATL,February 2016,3,3,4,3,4,3,no

I told an agent in ATL and gave her my information. 4 hours later when I landed, I had a phone call from an agent in TN saying they had my Kindle.

Delta Air Lines,1,Linda Keller,8th February 2016,Atlanta to Raleigh Durham. My mother and I were returning home from visiting my critically ill sister and had a horrible experience with Delta. My mother is elderly and physically disabled. She had a hip replacement recently and needed a seat were the arm rest would lift up. I had my medical alert service dog with me also. They booked us in a seat that would accommodate my dog but not my mother so she was moved a few seats back. I was told I either had to sit with her or she would have to move back to the seat reserved (which they did in error to begin with). The seat I was reserved had more room for my dog. However I had to move - why I do not know. My service dog (which is a large dog) was made to sit in a area where she was unable to move a muscle the whole flight.

Delta Air Lines,4,David Parker,8th February 2016,"Detroit to Amsterdam with Delta Air Lines and the staff were appalling, openly criticising customers. Some were overweight and barged up and down the aisles bashing into everyone's arms and shoulders. Delta should consider keener and more friendly staff. The food was very poor.

Experienced staff onboard very welcoming. Check in with ease and courtesy. Security check tedious and lengthy - over one hour at Terminal 4 at JFK due to high passenger volume. Drink service both ways with tiny snack, 2 small cookies or pretzels and soft drinks, coffee or tea. Pilots informative. Barely space for overhead luggage but allowed two unchecked hand luggage. Entire experience far superior to American or United (both dreadful) on this route and equal to Jet Blue (which has more legroom than any of the other 3 airlines which fly New York City-Bermuda).

This was my wedding so I wanted to have no issues. A month prior to my trip I noticed they had put me in different seats in a less desirable location. I contacted them and they explained to me that are not guaranteed. I flew to Florida in the seats I was forced to fly in. The night before we flew out of Florida I checked my flight to see if my flight was delayed. Once again I noticed my seats had changed for a second time but this time I was pushed from first class to coach and I was not sitting next to my wife and child. This was done without notice. I called Delta and explained the situation to them and they were very rude and said we got moved and there is nothing we can do besides switching flights. I have never ran into a airline that is more unorganized or disrespectful. For the amount of money spent to flight with this company I would highly recommend flying with someone else or pay a lot less for the same service.,,Family Leisure,First Class,MSP to RSW,January 2016,3,3,3,4,1,1,no

I was right to book Delta Air Lines on my way back to London Heathrow from New York JFK. I checked in using the Delta IOS app - very straightforward and efficient. Boarding was smooth and on time. The cabin crew were attentive and friendly. Other airlines must learn from Delta on this one. Most cabin crew from other airlines talk to you like a robot, mostly closed ended questions which is probably understandable when they are offering food for example. However, not all interactions must be of such nature. The food was great as well as the snacks. It did not look and taste horrible and cheap at all - a call out to Virgin Atlantic.

Amazing cabin crew provided excellent service throughout the flight, with many drink service runs. The return flight from Detroit to Paris was most disappointing in comparison - with unfriendly crew, after meal service not seen again until an hour before landing in Paris. No drink runs and when I asked about the meal the reply was impatient and uncaring.

The Delta experience was really solid, from the friendliness of ground and onboard staff to cleanliness of planes. I am partial to the A330 because the 2-4-2 seating feels less cramped than the 9 or 10 across seating in newer widebody aircraft. Seats reasonable for economy, AVOD had nice foreign film choices and everything worked. Food was OK at best, probably the weakest part of the experience but not bad. Checking into a Delta flight at CDG was a little puzzling due to using Air France desks.

I last flew a 747 5 years ago, when CX used it quite a lot on the HKG-LHR route. I fell in love with the 747 again, thanks to the amazing Delta service. Their online check in was without frills, very straight forward. When I arrived at the airport in Manila, I was greeted by a battalion of Delta ground crew. They were all very helpful and attentive. One of them carried my bag to be weighed, whilst two of them assisted me with checking in on the self-service kiosks. I was only meant to check one bag (as it says on the ticket), but, they gave me the option to check my hand luggage, which turned out to be very convenient for me. We boarded on time. We were greeted by friendly cabin crew. I always select seats at the end of the plane because from a 3-4-3 configuration for example, the last 3-5 rows will only be 2-4-2. The flight was packed but the service was superb. What I really liked about this flight was the captain keeping us informed in a very transparent and friendly way, and not to mention the cabin crew keeping us comfortable, fed, and hydrated. The inflight entertainment was good. The food was good too. We arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule. This flight will probably the last flight I will have on a 747.

We paid nearly $200 extra for a couple more inches of leg room. On the website it shows television monitors and the free entertainment package. There were no monitors and the only way to get free entertainment is to bring your own laptop or pad. I didn't have either thinking there were monitors, so I paid nearly $200 for a couple inches of more leg room. Even worse, on our flight back home there was a couple who asked to move to the seats we paid extra for and they let them move.

By the time we got to MSP we were tired hungry and much less than happy. But our last leg helped tremendously. The plane was a newer A319, and the flight crew was gracious, helpful and funny.

We waited in the airport for 2 hours, the plane was late, no big deal. We were patient. We finally go to board the plane and found that there was no window in aisle 33 on an A320. I don't get claustrophobic but on a plane when people would line up by the bathrooms commenting about how bad of a design it was, not to mention that you had to stand in the galley to wait for the bathrooms with 3 flight attendants trying to do their job was just the worst flying experience I have experienced.",A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,MEX to MSP,January 2016,1,4,,,2,1,no

They booked us on a flight from Atlanta to Boston and then to Richmond - they said we could go to the airport on Sunday (the day before the new flight) and said we could standby on each flight going to Richmond along with 150 other people and this meant running from each terminal and gate to be on the list. One time I might be 40 on the list, the next 15 and not get out.

We boarded the deboarded due to the weather. Then we boarded again, and deboarded again. It was a fiasco. By the time we got off the plane, there was no way to leave the airport. I was stuck at JFK for 2 days and am now awaiting my overnight layover in Atlanta. Enquired about a voucher for a hotel or meals but was told they don't offer for weather related cancellations.

While on the flight, we were informed that since it was a short flight, no drinks would be served in economy (which was annoying).

We were stocked in Huntsville, AL airport about 3.5inside the airplane. First because there was a thunderstorm in Atlanta, and that's totally comprehensible because it was for our safety, but then after 2 hours the airplane got a mechanical problem and when we finally were supposed to fly back to Atlanta, they kept us waiting for an additional 1.5 hours. At first they offered us water and snacks (first 30 minutes wait), but then we were there hungry, uncomfortable, without any Wi-Fi connection, and they did not offer us anything. Not a refund, not a meal, nothing. It was a very unpleasant experience and I understand that bad weather conditions is not Delta's fault, they do not have any control on it and they did everything to keep us safe that day. However, if they knew there was a mechanical problem in the airplane, I would expect at least that they change us to a different airplane or if it is a minor problem but they would keep us waiting for more time, have the consideration to offer us something in return for that wait, it could be a meal because that is a proper way to treat your clients, not keep them there in that condition inside the airplane for such a long time.",Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,STL to ATL,December 2015,3,2,1,,2,1,no

Beginning with the boarding process, we boarded slightly late. Then with no notice they started boarding us. I was welcomed on board and made my way to the seat. The seat and private space was smaller than I am used to from flying with AA, but it is also a smaller aircraft. The seat offered a full recline, duvet and pillow. I found the seat fairly comfortable and although there was a massage function, it wasn't very effective. I also found there to be very little space to store anything small in the seat. Additional there was no call button for the crew. I was provided an amenity kit which was a very nice Tumi case. After settling in I was offered a drink. The TV display was smaller than I expected with an adequate range of entertainment. The aircraft was WIFI equipped. After take-off I was offered a hot-towel and had my drink order taken, then served a very nice dinner which I could chose from a menu. I found the cabin crew of a very high standard, they went above and beyond and made sure every request was taken care of quickly. This was probably one of the most professional premium class crew I have had the pleasure of experiencing.

Delta Air Lines,1,Erin McCamley,14th January 2016,"When I have flown with Delta in the past, the comfort of the actual flight was great. The customer service, however, is a nightmare. I booked a roundtrip flight, and then had to cancel because of scheduling. I cancelled my entire flight within 30 minutes of booking it. I called Delta to confirm I had cancelled and would receive a full refund. The service agent told me everything was confirmed and I would receive a full refund because it was within 24 hours. 8 days went by and I hadn't received a refund yet. I called Delta on 3 different days and was hung up on, transferred, put on hold, and hung up again on multiple times. The third day, I finally got a hold of a real person and told her my predicament. She said ""That did not occur. That confirmation number you gave me doesn't exist. You'll have to apply for a refund through the website and then it will be up to the auditor's discretion whether or not you receive a refund."" I said, ""But now it's been 8 days, so the auditor will refuse to refund me. I cancelled it within 24 hours - in fact, within one hour - and received confirmation that I did. Are you seriously telling me that whoever I spoke to 8 days ago was just making stuff up and now I'm just out $1200 for no reason?"" She was condescending and cruel, cutting me off. Her official response was that what I was saying never happened and there was nothing anyone could do. All I could do was apply for a refund and the rest was up to the auditor. If I had been able to reach a live person one of the other days I had called, or if the person I had spoken to that night had actually confirmed my cancellation, I would have $684.70 to pay other bills. $684.70 is way too much money for me to just lose.

I was exhausted, frustrated and stressed and all I wanted was a little assistance finding a place to stay in NYC. She just repeated ""Ain't my problem. I don't control the weather."" Over and over. This was a manager by the way. A TSA agent felt the need to apologize on her behalf! For something also out of my control - I had to eat the hotel charge.

Delta Air Lines,2,E Smith,11th January 2016,"We arrived at the Charlotte, NC airport around 7:45 am, giving us more than enough time to prepare and check in for our flight out at 9:45 am. To begin our day of misfortune, our flight was delayed due to weather purposes, which is understandable, till around 10:15 am. As we were flying out from Charlotte to our connecting flight in Detroit, we realized that we only had, what we thought, was a 38 minute layover to make it to our next flight out of Detroit. However, as we were leaving the terminal, we learned that the connecting flight was not delayed at all and we had approximately 3 minutes to make it to the gate before the flight began its departure. As I ran ahead and sprinted to the gate to try and save my family and I some grief, I was greeted by a Delta representative who proceeded to inform me that I was to late to get on the flight, even though I could physically see our plane sitting in the loading spot, motionless. So, my family, along with around 15 other people who experienced the same I convienemt timing and planning due to Delta, watched the flight we had payed for depart in front of us. To try to salvage this situation, the crowd of left behind passengers began to congregate to the airlines help kiosk, where we virtually on went to be told that we needed to call and contact a Delta representative about changing flights - even though there was a representative standing right in front of us. To make things even better, once we had finally jumped through enough hoops and made it onto our flight from Detroit to Las Vegas (6 hours later), we were surprised to find out that not only did any of our luggage make it to Las Vegas, but they were sent on a flight that departed 3 hours after we were scheduled to land. So, after speaking with a Delta baggage representative who realistically was no help, my family and probably 5-10 other passengers sat in the Las Vegas terminal for upwards to 3-3 1/2 hours before finally receiving our baggage. Not to mention that all of this was at the expense of us passengers, with the Delta representative claiming that ""there was nothing that they could do"".

Supposedly, premium economy provides complimentary beverages. On a 4.5 hr flight I consumed 3 units of white wine and several club sodas. The flight attendant then informed me, and everyone within earshot that she ""did not feel comfortable serving me any more alcohol"". I have never experienced this in first class, or coach. When I called to complain about the lack of promised services and the atrociously rude behavior of the flight attendant, I received incredibly rude service and no compensation for the $50 a piece glasses of wine which is what I ended up paying.

On our return, we flew into Laguardia and waited to board our last flight to finally get home, when we were told there was a medical emergency on board and the plane would be late. As time went by the reason was quickly changed to bad weather so that the airline would not be responsible for any expenses they would have to pay out to their customers. Most of us were rerouted the next morning at 6:00am first bound for Atlanta, and then returning north to our final destination. I can't tell you how many passengers were left without a place to go, (they told us the terminal would be closed overnight,) and when we asked for food vouchers and water, we were all told that ""Delta no longer provides these things for their customers when flights are cancelled."" Had they not told their usual lies, many of us could have helped ourselves before it was too late. With a whole lot of angry people demanding answers, I would have hated to be the one behind the counter. We all asked to speak to the supervisor - she was of no help whatsoever.

No Line at fast track and bags already on carousel so overall a good experience. LHR-BHM wasn't quite so smooth. Food terrible & this is not an understatement. I had baked cod that was described as crispy, but in fact was chewy and slightly rancid, so I didn't eat it. As I usually find eating in a plane more of a diversion than anything else I was happy to pass on the food. My son chose basil tortellini but bizarrely came in a cream green curry sauce. Not sure what the were thinking when they came up with this menu. Not nearly as good as Eastboud USA origination. My wife had the oxtail that she said was really nice, so I guess my son and I just made poor choices. Service (apart from 1 FA) could only be described as frosty. Landed ATL 20 mins early. Security a breeze. Now the fun begins. I picked up a text from DL to inform me connection was delayed by 45 mins, no big deal here, but as it was last flight out on Xmas eve and seeing the lines for rebooking I was starting to get a bad feeling. Then the flight delayed another hour. The heart starts to pound a little more, then 15 mins before boarding and it gets cancelled. Was then given 2 options 9.55pm on Xmas day or 6.10, but couldn't accommodate all 3 of us so we would have to choose who was in which flight. Really! Delta sucks when it comes to these type of occurrences. Yes, the delay was weather related and was mostly out of their control, but to have no reasonable back up plan is poor. They had already cancelled one of the earlier ATL-BHM flights, so surely could have anticipated this a little better. In the end I managed to get a car from Avis and drive myself, so all was not lost. If I had taken Delta's option I'd no doubt be feeling a little like Tom Hanks in the 'traveller'! To be fair to Delta they did offer a hotel for the night.

Delta Air Lines,2,Louis Uridel,25th December 2015,"So our flight hasn't even taken off yet. And already there is an issue. We had upgraded to Delta comfort on our flight from New York JFK to Amsterdam, a long international flight. The biggest reason for this is there were only 2 seats in the row which was perfect for my fiancé and I. However, upon checking in - we find our row now has 3 seats - and I'm at the window. And she is in the aisle. With someone in between us. We called Delta and they apologized, but could do nothing about it. It's our first big international trip and either we are apart from each other the whole flight or someone is getting stuck in the middle. Neither of which is very appealing. We normally only fly American. I guess we should have stuck with what we know instead of taking a chance on Delta.",,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,JFK to AMS,December 2015,2,,,,2,2,no

Hundreds of Delta passengers were stranded in an airport on Xmas eve and they gave us no answers and no apologies or vouchers were offered. The staff was incredibly callous and unsympathetic. They had 1 customer service rep to help over a hundred people in line. The situation was handled so badly. I've never been treated so poorly by an airline.

At the end, they ended up de-planing us, made us walk back through customs and immigration, and then had a large line-up to re-book flights. When they booked us on a flight, they ended up delaying that flight without telling us, and then they tried to put us on another airline very last minute, made us walk all the way to the other end of the airport where the counter told us that flight had already left.

When the steward came round to give us peanuts and biscuits I asked him if he could turn the aircon down - he told me to cover my legs with a blanket - as I'd already done this and was still cold I asked if he could turn the aircon down as I'm cold. He said I don't agree with you, it's a good temperature and if I turn it down the other passengers will be too warm. He was so dismissive of my request and abrupt that I was embarrassed by his attitude. My flight home was an unpleasant experience as he was passing me for the whole flight (I fell asleep and missed breakfast so had to ask him for one, he went and got me one then threw it on my table) to be treated like that on what should be a pleasant experience was unacceptable.

Delta Air Lines,8,Bryce Farmer,24th December 2015,"Our trip to Brussels started out in Austin, Texas with a short two hour flight to Atlanta, as per usual when flying transatlantic with Delta, you are usually directed through Atlanta, New York, or Detroit. The domestic first class seats were comfortable enough, and there was a charging port between the seats as well, however there was no inflight entertainment. We were offered snacks like peanuts, potato chips, and crackers out of a basket, and all drinks were free. However, because of the short length of the flight there was no meal service, and even some of the larger snacks like tapas were unavailable. The flight attendants were polite and nice, but they were not above and beyond, and didn't interact with the passengers more than they had to. As we were flying in the Delta One cabin international, we got free access to the Sky Club, however with so many people flying for the holidays, it was overly crowded, and a restaurant by our boarding gate was a much better option to spend our two hour layover. When the flight from Atlanta to Brussels finally boarded, we were promptly offered champagne or orange juice. There was a Westin pillow and comforter set, TUMI amenities kit with a pen, lip balm and lotion, eye mask, socks, tissues, mouthwash, and earplugs. After passengers were seated, attendants brought cashews and refilled our champagne. About an hour after take off dinner service included option of beef or cod. The inflight entertainment was rather limited with about 30 or so movies and a handful of television shows on seatback screens. The staff was friendly, but didn't quite go out of their way to do anything.

We finally boarded and then had to wait on the tarmac for an hour due to heavy air traffic. The Captain kept us up to date, but still we were an hour late. There was one FA in Business and three in Economy. They announced that the beverage service would begin shortly and that passengers in Business and Delta Comfort were entitled to complimentary drinks, which was one of the reasons I booked DC in addition to the additional legroom. The beverage service started and we were in the second row of the Comfort seats. Everyone around me ordered soda, coffee, water but no one order an alcoholic drink even though it was late afternoon. When the surly flight attendant got to me I asked for a double gin and tonic. Without smiling she asked if I wanted the whole can. I figured it would save her time so I said yes. She couldn't find tonic in her drawer, harrumphed and walked back to get one. Upon returning she asked if I wanted one cup or two. I told her one would be fine. As she opened the first of the two gin bottles she looked at me and said, ""I'll give you these two but that's all you're going to get."" (She wasn't kidding.) I was dumbfounded. I didn't have any intention of ordering more, but I didn't need her to ensure I knew I wouldn't be getting any more - regardless of the fact that I was in a seat entitled to ""complimentary drinks"" (no mention of a limit). She pushed her cart to the next row and moved on. Later in the flight I wanted some water and got up and went to the rear galley, where the three FA's were enjoying one of the cheese and cracker snack boxes. They were talking and I didn't want to interrupt, but waited until one of them noticed me standing in the doorway. After several minutes one of them did and asked, ""What can I get you?"" ""A bottle of water please."" Her terse reply, ""We don't have bottled water,"" to which I replied, ""Fine then. A cup of water please."" She turned around, tossed the cup on top of the bin of ice on the cart, sloshed some water in the cup and handed it to me, never asking if I wanted ice (the water was room temp). I returned to my seat, looked at my husband and said Delta sucks. I understand if FA's are miserable when dealing with nasty passengers, but when the passenger is being polite there is no need to be surly and curt.

As we got into line with three people ahead of us, two off the four customer service agents went on break leaving two agents with six available terminals. After waiting in line for an hour, another agent went on break, leaving one agent. When she was finished with her customer, a sky priority customer jumped ahead to her station, and she helped him, even though there were four sky priority agents working. Then another customer, from nowhere cut the entire line, and she let her do this. No back up - yet only one agent. Finally, 2 agents came back from break, and lucky us our agent could only get us on a flight 10 hours later, we were offered no comps, and no upgrades. I was crying when I told our agent that I would be charged an extra 100 dollars by our rental car company, which I don't have the money for, and he just said sorry.

During a long haul flight the queues for the toilet were constant and a disturbance, also being the last seats on the plane our choice of food was non existent as we had to have what was left. I contacted customer service at Delta from New York as I did not want the return flight to be as bad. I was informed that I should or could have chosen my seats when I booked online to begin with and this was on the website, which I have to confess I had not seen or noticed (but I will look out for it next time I book). I explained I was not happy and was offered seats further down the plane at a cost of $40.00 each (total of $160.00), I told the lady in customer services that I was unhappy that I had to pay an extra $160.00 for something I could have had for free and she very kindly spoke to her supervisor and waived the costs which was very good of Delta.

I am so angry! My husband has the car, plus it is at 1:30 hour round trip. They didn't say a word about a different policy because it was late check in. We should have just thrown out the jelly, but that would be expecting us to know their policies. I do not know whether the person who took the report was lying to me or simply incompetent. The seats were horribly uncomfortable on both parts of the trip. They want you to put carry-on items under the seats, but the seats are so close that it is very difficult to get them out again. The aisles are so narrow that even really skinny people hit other travelers when they walk down the aisles. The final part of our trip was delayed because the previous flight was late getting there. One of the flight crew kept trying to speed up the boarding process. He yelled at people not to block the aisles, and to let others around them. That seems like fine advice, but it seems he didn't notice that a lot of the people didn't speak English.

I booked a paid first class seat for myself and then a day before my trip my son decided he wanted to come with me, so I paid for him to travel along side. I spent 30 mins on phone to Delta arranging his ticket, was given a seat assignment etc etc. The next day when checking in my son had a seat request boarding pass, so checked in with gate agent and was given 12A for my son and 1D for me. I told them he had been assigned a seat next to me in row 1. They checked computer etc and said that was impossible as the PAX in that seat had purchased in October. I asked if that PAX had been awarded an upgrade and if so as I had a paid 1st class would they be able to downgrade a non paid 1st class. I was then told they couldn't do that. So as the plane is boarding I call their prem Skymiles number and explained. I was told by them that they never oversell in 1st class and should have downgraded someone, probably even had a couple of non-revs in that cabin. As it was a short flight I ended up downgrading myself also as my son is only 8. Eventually I got a decent credit with Delta, but was pretty mad about their process as it simply makes no sense to downgrade a paid customer and enforce a 2nd paid customer to also downgrade themselves.",MD88,Family Leisure,First Class,BHM to ATL,November 2015,3,3,,,1,1,no

Unlike AA, I have zero ""privileges"" / status on DL, but even with that the flights were far better than what I have become accustomed to. Boarding on the two outbound and the two return segments went smoothly. Ground staff, and cabin staff were friendly, smiling, and even uttered words like ""please"" and ""thank you,"" which the AA employees forgot sometime back in the 1990s. Their uniforms were neat, clean and pressed. The boarding process, even in ""Zone 2,"" was organized and efficient, again in contrast to the priority boarding / rugby scrum I usually encounter at AA gates in Miami. DL pulls off boarding, somehow, with only one agent, which probably cuts labor costs and frees up more money for amenities like charging stations all over their Atlanta terminals.

I've been pushed to the limit and will make a note, of the terrible service that I've received on Delta. I'm on flight AF9301 seat 41H from Minneapolis to Paris CDG. Flight attendant takes the poor Delta service to a new low. First, she is ramming her food cart onto seats and passengers shoulders and proceeds with no remorse or even a simple excuse me. Just passed with a drinks cart, looks like she looks at faces, and chooses who she will ask if they need a drink or not. She clearly ignored me as I awaited to get a drink, and I must say, I have never felt disrespected this much. I had to politely ask another attendant if drinks were for purchase or complementary, just to calm my head. Across the isle, an elderly woman who clearly doesn't speak English motioned for service, unable to clearly get the message across, the woman pointed towards the snacks on the cart the FA was pushing, then the FA grabbed a bunch of snack peanut packets, and literally threw them at the elderly woman. When I asked why the attendants seemed so disrespectful, a senior attendant mentioned something along the lines of staffing etc, which I personally, thought was an excuse, as the aircraft seemed to be less than half full. If had a choice, I would never fly Delta again. Unfortunately Delta is too big an airline, that my choices are narrowed and I keep finding myself on Delta flights.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Paris,November 2015,4,1,2,2,3,1,no

I had been visiting family in Florida when I had to go into the hospital for emergency surgery. Upon release we flew home. Every step of the way Delta employees went out of their way to make the trip as easy as possible. They were efficient and friendly, and made what could have been a painful trip totally smooth. Wheelchairs were waiting at every point; the flight attendants were caring and attentive, and our luggage was checked as a courtesy and was waiting for us when we arrived at baggage claim.

It appears this toilet is for business class only and my girlfriend was not only challenged by a horrible air steward but a middle aged passenger who took it upon himself to block the aisle and become obnoxious to her - I made my feelings pretty clear to him as you can imagine. In general the staff were unhelpful and just not interested, the complete opposite from the Virgin crew we had on the outward journey. The food was not good plus the inflight entertainment system was not working properly.

Delta Air Lines,1,J Kuma,26th November 2015,"Delta cancelled Flight 0135 from Amsterdam to Detroit on November 19, 2015 because the Delta crew did not show up to fly the plane. It was a full flight with many passengers having already flown for some 8 hours already internationally to Amsterdam. The baggage and food was loaded onto the flight, the KLM representatives were at the gate to board everyone, and then we were told the crew simply did not show up to fly the plane. Later the flight was cancelled - without any announcement or posting on the electronic boards, and hundreds of passengers had to stand about 7 hours in line to get rebooked!! People were exhausted. Many had other horror stories about past experiences with Delta that some said cancelled flights for no reason at all or because they can. Unprofessional and unreliable. Avoid if you can.

We completely understand about malfunctions and the crew was able to get everyone on the flight on another plane within an hour. My biggest complaint was the fact that once we boarded our second plane we had to wait an additional hour bc we were waiting for the catering cart to arrive. My recommendation would be to wait until the plane is ready to go before boarding passengers. There was a few passengers that we're getting impatient and one passenger even had an outburst saying ""who cares about the food, let's just go. Let's Go!"" Our seats were bad this time but no fault to Delta we just had kids behind us both flights and the first flight a kid pulled my wife's hair and on the second flight a kid and their parents kept bumping our seats. Normally we have very good experiences with Delta airlines and I would recommend them over some other airlines.

Delta Air Lines,7,David Bergstrom,25th November 2015,"Flew Delta in First from AUS to SAN, via SLC roundtrip. I’M Silver with Delta, Platinum with AA and Gold with Virgin. Delta ranks third for their First Class offering. Seat pitch is the tightest at 37”, the food options on flights under 900 miles is a snack basket. As a Sky Club member, in addition to Admirals Club membership, we used both. I feel Delta’s Clubs are minimalistic in comparison. The bars are small and the food offering are somewhat amateurish. Don’t get me wrong. Boarding was orderly and we did not have to wait due to Priority. The planes were clean, the seat cushion is comfortable. All our flights left on time and arrived on time. Breakfast served to SLC, a plate with a Bagel Breakfast Sandwich on it, a side dish with some fruit. The Quality and taste were fine, the meal just looked un substantial compared to my other proffered carriers. The flight attendant to SLC was pleasant, did his job quickly and sat and read for the remainder of the flight. The Flight to SAN had a very proactive flight crew, constantly in the aisle, refilling drinks and constantly passing the snack basket, with some decent offerings. The return flight to SLC offered again the snack basket and some wine. A somewhat cold, but very professional attendant served us on this leg. She performed her job very well. The last flight to Austin offered dinner. After my earlier in the week breakfast flight, I was not expecting much. I was surprised to be offered a perfectly cooked Fillet, with sides and a dinner roll. Desert sadly was a pre packed brownie (Really, Prepackaged in First). All in all Delta did its job, we were spot on time and our bags came out fairly quickly. The food offering are spares in compared to other, but what was offered was of decent quality. We fly a lot, hence the Elite status with (3) carriers. Delta, while still good, ii is still my 3rd choice. The inflight GoGo Entertainment failed completely on all four legs.

Then we had to wait for the flight attendants to arrive before we could even board. So instead of boarding at 9:41pm we had to wait even longer before we could even board.

Delta Air Lines,3,M Fisher,19th November 2015,"We have flown Delta on numerous occasions as we have a house and business in US. Our honest opinion is that in general we use Delta because we prefer to fly from our local airport, and this is a service supplied in conjunction with Air France and KLM via Paris / Amsterdam. Overall, the service is poor. We have found cabin staff mostly friendly and helpful, though not always. Food is usually ok but I am afraid that on numerous flights pre booked months in advance, my family are seated in different parts of the plane, most unacceptable particularly dissappointing when you have booked a family holiday months in advance. When challenging them about this we get nowhere. The last flight we checked in online and received a telephone call to say all was ok but when we were checking our luggage in on the return journey we were told at check in 'oh this flight goes tomorrow evening'! Now after much arguing and apologies we were put on a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt but 35 hours door to door from US to UK is totally unacceptable. This experience on numerous occasions has made us reconsider. The flight experience is far too much hassle for a family and I have to say I am relieved we do not have to endure this ever again. I have complained to the airline on a number of occasions but as yet I have received no response. In my opinion Delta are a letdown to the whole ethos of customer service and care in the US and I will certainly not contemplate using their services again.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newcastle to Orlando,August 2015,2,2,3,3,2,2,no

While waiting for boarding Delta has an area for economy class passengers in Narita Airport. I've found it very relaxing and comfortable because they do have a reclining chair which where you could take a nap (but just be mindful of your boarding time). Boarding was smooth, and onboard the flight attendants are very nice, especially the Japanese crews. The only regret on my experience is that the IFE is poor - they have limited movies to watch.

However this time the flight from MCO was cancelled whilst we were waiting to board (""aircraft is broke""), and we were informed replacement was being sent from ATL, which wouldn't land at MCO until after LHR flight had departed. Mad panic with a full Boeing 757 passenger list trying to contact Delta customer services using the 6 available telephones. Eventually got through, and was offered flight from ATL to Paris, with a connection to LHR. Had to point out to the operator this would take-off whilst we were en-route to ATL. Eventually got offered flight to Philadelphia, to connect to a London flight the next evening. Asked if there was a way to contact England to advise our taxi company not to pick us up until following day. They said they had no international calling arrangements. Got to ATL about 10:45 at night, then spent about an hour trying to arrange overnight hotel (three quarter full flight, and 4 customer service clerks). Eventually given voucher for hotel, and told to wait at the hotel shuttle pick up point outside. Hotel shuttle didn't turn up, and wasn't listed on list of hotel contacts to allow us to contact it. Eventually driver from another hotel took pity on the 14 of us booked to that hotel, and took us there. The hotel also had no way of making international calls. Next morning we found voucher was for accommodation only - we had to pay for breakfast! Flight to Philly was ok-ish (a MD88 is not as good as a 757). London-bound plane was a half-empty 757. However, although Premium Economy was almost empty we were still only allowed in Economy unless we were willing to pay for upgrade. The only time previously we have had a rearranged flight, also because of broken aircraft, was with BA who automatically upgraded us. Was also surprised that , if we wanted to watch any of the films on offer, we would have to pay by credit card. Never had this before on a transatlantic flight - even Delta ones. However cannot fault the onboard flight crew or service. The seats, however were uncomfortable, and 9 hours is a long time to sit in an uncomfortable seat. When we got back to LHR, no checked baggage. They were delivered to our home later that day on 2 separate deliveries, because one had arrived on a later Delta flight from JFK, the other had arrived on an earlier Virgin flight, also from JFK! So, in addition to us having an extra wasted day, Delta have caused us to be out of pocket for meals we wouldn't have had to pay for, and a taxi that went to LHR to meet us. The in-flight experience is ok. It is the customer service side that needs attention.

We especially appreciated the overhead compartment valet service in Atlanta, our only experience.

Food was barely edible, the orange juice with breakfast was still frozen! Seat pocket was torn, the cabin was shabby and tired. Delayed by +2 hours.

The trip from Hawaii to Seattle was overnight, a little less comfortable (it was an economy seat) than the trans Atlantic and packed as an early flight had been cancelled some months earlier. Myself and others offered to have our hand held put in the hold and this worked fine as these bags were the first ones off in Seattle. Third leg was going fine 'til we started take off down the runway. Whereupon the plane slowed and returned to the gate. Apparently a generator had failed so we de-planed and waited 3 hours for a replacement. We were kept informed all the time and given snacks and beverages. Just as about a 100 pizza boxes arrived they announced we could re board and off we went. Unfortunate delay but these things happen and otherwise a routine flight back across the pond.

Delta Air Lines,1,Victoria Chester,25th October 2015,"Last minute flight so I paid $750 CAD for this roundtrip in premium economy. Flight to SFO was smooth - with connection in Seattle. Flight home was bad: I arrived SFO at 11:45 am for 2pm flight. I received a message from Delta that flight was delayed and to contact them. I left the gate, through security, to check-in desk and they advised that the new departure of 2:38 was still good for my connection. Back to the gate, where before boarding an offer was announced to provide a $400 voucher for anyone who would stay behind, which I did not select because I had plans. We boarded at approx 2:30. Approx 2:45 the captain announced we would be held at the gate. We took off at approx 3:10 - at this point I knew I would need to rush to catch connection, which was from different terminal in LAX. We landed LAX &and were held on the tarmac, I deplaned at approx 4:48 to catch departing flight to Calgary Canada on WestJet (codeshare) at 5:05. I obtained assistance through security and ran to the gate in my socks to find the flight gone. I called Delta - they said the next flight would be the next morning. I went back to the other terminal and to the help desk - where we spent over an hour looking at every connection I could find (Vegas, Salt Lake, Vancouver) but every flight had a connection too close to make it home - so I gave in and arranged for the morning flight on WestJet. I asked for Delta to provide me with a Hotel - the answer was no. Supervisor gave me a discount voucher. Next I went downstairs to get my luggage. I was told it was with WestJet and I could not get it because WestJet personnel were not there, but not to worry it would be on my flight tomorrow. I got upset and the very helpful team actually went over got my luggage. Now it is 8:30pm, 3.5 hours after my flight landed. I entered the website for the hotel, as per directions on the coupon. Site was blank for LAX. I called the phone number on the voucher and was told there was no availability for LAX! I called my husband - who went on the internet to search Airport hotels - everything was showing as FULL or over $350 for a 2 star. Thinking this was only because of how late it was, I called several of these hotels and was told they were indeed booked. I was offered expensive hotels miles away - no shuttle. I needed to be at the airport 2.5 hours before my 8am International flight (because I did not have a boarding pass with the change, I was told to arrive extra early for the flight). So this was unacceptable - I went back up to the Delta help desk to tell them to get me a hotel. I was again told by the supervisor they will not help with a hotel. Agent even left to confirm the voucher was not valid and hotels were indeed booked. I saw they had a flight posted leaving LAX at 9:45pm to Oakland (same are as SFO). I asked to be put on that flight but they would not do it - saying that was 2 legs and I only had 1 leg of my flight left. I had to pay $305 ($400 CAD) for 1 way to OAK, as flight was leaving and decision had to be made. Terrible",,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,SFO to YYC via LAX,October 2015,4,4,5,,5,1,no

The flight was on time, boarding was smooth. The supply of food, snack and drinks was really good. The quality of the food was pretty good and they serve pretty big portions too. The plane was a Boeing 767, seats in the economy section are pretty much standard, but more comfortable than other airlines I have used.

Delta Air Lines,4,H Gardner,22nd October 2015,"Delta Air Lines from Seattle to Anchorage in exit row. Delta has an unusually cramped cabin, even in First Class, so I was relieved to get the exit row. On takeoff, a strip of plastic from the overhead bin compartment fell off and hit me and the guy behind me in the head repeatedly. It was light enough that it was an inconvenience rather than a cause for alarm or injury, but it does call maintenance into question. Then the cabin crew proceeded to serve six bottles of booze to the gentleman seated next to me, despite the fact that he was visibly intoxicated after the first four. Not sure how he'd assist with the emergency exit when he was drunk enough to begin making phone calls as soon as we could see the destination in the distance and yelling obscenities into his phone. Cabin crew ignored this just as they ignored the fact that they over served him beyond any reasonable margin of error. They'd sell him six bottles of tequila, but they only came through the cabin to provide half glasses of ice with a splash of soft drink on a three hour flight. This is on par with what I've come to expect from Delta Airlines. At least I wasn't in First Class this time, and had some leg room (Delta's First Class cabin is as tightly packed as their steerage class rows.)",Boeing 737,Business,Economy Class,SEA to ANC,October 2015,2,1,2,,2,4,no

The customer service is absolutely horrible, staff is rude. I say make them sleep on an airport floor for a night, and then tell me they're sorry for the inconvenience. Every gate attendant I dealt with has been rude and not wanting to find flights for us, and acted as though I asked them to do something that was impossible. I would never recommend flying with Delta to my worst enemy. An announcement came over they were offering $500 vouchers for people to give up their seats, when we were offered nothing for them making us miss our flights.

She was also unable to purchase economy comfort seats (none available), so we ended up in economy. As with the flight from SLC to CDG, the seats in the return CDG to SEA flight were the worst I've experienced - cramped, inadequate padding, solid armrests, and hardly any recline. This was a day flight - I didn’t sleep well the night before, and was unable to take a nap. Seat discomfort made my flight experience miserable. My spouse and I forgot to bring our seat backs to the upright position before landing at SEA, and the FAs didn’t notice. That’s how minimal the recline is. Once again, food quality had deteriorated from my last transatlantic Delta flight in January 2014. I forgot to buy take on food at CDG. Delta offered a wide selection of movies, but the free headset's poor sound quality made it impossible to enjoy them. My 1-star rating for entertainment is based on the headset’s poor sound quality.

The pilot proceeded to ask if we could land in a different airport so that our whole weekends weren't ruined.

Delta Air Lines,2,John Quinteros,8th October 2015,"First my Delta Air Lines flight got delayed but I was able to re-book it the night before. The guy who answered my call was not very understanding and frustrated me even more. Then the morning of my flight I got there 3 hours early (3:00 am) only to be told that the flight was delayed because the captain was missing. I missed my connecting flight which meant I had to be re routed and had to wait six hours in New York. I was supposed to get to DC at 10 AM and got there at 4:30 pm. Wasted my day at the airport. Coming back, my flight was again delayed and I once again missed my connecting flight. I had to book to another flight. It was a direct flight but basically had to wait 6.5 hours at the airport for it to take off. Then my gate for the new flight got changed twice. Then my 12:22 flight got delayed again to 2:00pm or so. I was supposed to be in Montreal at noon and instead arrived at around 3:10 or so. The one positive was that the direct flight was extremely fast and made it to Montréal in an hour and 10 minutes. My carry on met the specifications but I was told to leave it on the side of the entrance of the plane because it did not fit in the overhead cabinet? So why do you give specs that do not work? That would be ok except that one of the zippers in my luggage got ripped off and there was a tear on the side of the luggage. Way to take care of my stuff guys. I admit that the staff were very nice and they tried to be understanding. I received a 50$ voucher to use at a later date but will I really use this airline again? Do I want to take a chance? How many delays can a human being take in one trip? They also gave me a 15$ voucher to eat at the airport because I had to wait so long. I understand stuff happens.

Delta Air Lines,1,Patty Voje,4th October 2015,"This was hands down the worst travel experience in my life. Apparently the Delta Air Lines flight out of Florence was cancelled to due wind. Delta (and their partner KLM) had my flight bussed to the Pisa airport, (with no explanation, the pilot on the next flight explained). There we were told that we'd be dropped off at our plane that was ""waiting"" and no worries about our connecting flights in Amsterdam. There was no plane waiting in Pisa. We were dropped off with no direction in the Pisa airport parking lot, we had to go back through security and stand in lines trying to figure out which flight we were suppose to take. By the time we made it to Amsterdam the connecting flights were long gone. The KLM/Delta service people, were rude and unhelpful. They would tell us to get in a specific line, where'd we'd wait for over an hour, then they tell us to go to a different part of the airport and get in a different line. The connecting flights that were missed for some reason could not be rebooked at the airport and we were told we had to call Delta ourselves and reschedule. To which, after two attempts at 1.5 hours each spent on hold I was finally able to rebook my flight at an international calling rate of $2 an hour, so I spent over $400 just to rebook the flight. That doesn't include the rest of the costs I incurred at my two days at the airport. And of course they lost my luggage. And of course they don't care. I just keep getting transferred over to different ""customer service lines"" where I have to wait on hold and then repeat everything.

Delta Air Lines,1,N Van Der Heyden,2nd October 2015,"I have flown Delta thinking that they were the best. Until my flight from LAX to SLC was rerouted to Grand Junction where we sat on the tarmac for 3 hours. I know they cannot help weather, which is not what upsets me. It is that once I finally landed in SLC my next flight to Billings had just taken off. Again, I know not something they can help. At this point everything for the next 24 hours was booked, there wasn't even a hotel they could get me in for the night. Again, not something that they can control. So I rented a car and drove through the night on my own accord and expense. The complaint is that when I went to get the ticket refunded I called customer service before even leaving the airport while the flight to Billings was in the air and they insisted that I needed to wait until I completed my flight back to Honolulu before anything could be done. So 2 weeks later, I get back and make a call. Somehow it says that I flew the flight. Every person I called said that they couldn't do anything and gave me another number to call or sent me to the airport. It took me another 2 weeks of calling everyday to find someone who had any idea and knowledge on what to do. I have people telling me to go to the airport and others saying there was no need to go to the airport and they were sorry I was sent there. Well the person who knew what they were talking about, sent me back to the airport and told me who to talk to. I had to get a letter from the airport stating that I didn't fly on that flight. Now, almost a month after getting that paper and 2 months after not getting on that flight, I finally get an email saying it is up for review, but I need a letter from my bank stating that it is okay to give a cash refund. I am so sick and tired of the terrible customer service and the lack of care that 99% of their workers showed. Being that I live in Hawaii, I am 6 hours behind their time, I have had to get up early on my days off just to make sure that I can get through to speak with anyone. I even had a lady say to stay up and call when they open.

No notification just let us get up and drive to the airport at 3:50am. After some time on the phone we managed to get a milk run to Salt Lake city taking three different flights to get there and only arriving 2 hours later than originally anticipated. Not so bad considering we spent 17 hours traveling from Halifax to Salt Lake. Return flight, they get us to Mey York on time but the connector home is delayed again another three hours. No compensation. Nothing. Lots of I am sorry but this company doesn't value customers time consistently. Claiming weather is the problem in Washington when we are leaving NYC for Halifax and the weather is fine in both spots. I don't understand what Washington rain has to do with it. Very frustrated. My last flight with Delta was the same, lost a days vacation at Walt Disney for a family of five because of mechanical failure and flight cancellation. They provided us 100 dollar travel vouchers each to fly Delta within 1 year that we never got to take advantage of and they expired.

Delta Air Lines,8,Jaret Rapp,18th September 2015,"An overall pleasant experience. I upgraded to Delta Comfort+ on the first leg of the journey and chose seats right behind first class bulkhead. There was more than ample leg room. The Comfort+ seats also recline a little further as well, and include priority boarding and free drinks. At ANC airport, there were several other airlines with lines that seemed to go on forever, I think one of them was American. There was no line for Delta and the check in agents were friendly. Flight left on time, landed in ATL on time, and our connecting fight to Miami in a different terminal also was on time. While the MD-80 on the second leg was clean, and seemed to have been refurbished, I do not enjoy flying on those older planes as the cabin pressure is horrible. All bags arrived.

Delta Air Lines,3,Liz Simmons,18th September 2015,"Purchased Delta Air Lines first class tickets from Portland to DC via Salt Lake, leaving at 1:39 pm. At 11:00 am Delta delayed flight so that we would be missing the connection. Their email said they would re-schedule us; the re-schedule was then supposed to be on the red eye, arriving the following day! When we went to ask if there wasn't space on an earlier flight (they had several in the afternoon, going to DC), we were told no - every seat taken. As we sat waiting in the lounge, another passenger overheard our situation and told us she had just been upgraded to first class on one of these flights and there were open seats on them. When we inquired again, the Delta rep admitted that there were in fact first class seats available on those other afternoon flights, but our first class tickets could not be transferred to these seats and they are not allowed to switch us to those seats - different code (?) I feel sorry for the employee who had to explain this embarrassing rip off to us. So after making our original itinerary impossible, Delta's ""code"" policy would not allow us to take available seats on the other afternoon flights, forced us to sit in the Portland airport for 12 hours and then take a red eye flight overnight and arrive 24 hours after our original check in. Nice going Delta.

Delta Air Lines,2,Teresa Cho,12th September 2015,"I have never been particularly impressed by any US airline but this Delta Air Lines trip to fly Seattle to Moscow via Paris takes the cake in terms of incompetence and lack of accountability. The flight was SEA-CDG-SVO and was initially meant to depart at 1:00pm. First delay was 4 hours for mechanical issues. This meant a rebooking of my connecting flight, no problem. Around 5:00pm, still no plane in sight. Around 6pm, announcement that plane was here and being prepped but needed to be fueled for the trip and the crew is about to be timed out so once the plane is ready, you better be ready to board. No problem. After more than 5 hours and only a couple of slices of cold pizza as compensation, we were ready to get out of there. Once boarded another announcement, some passengers did not board (they were the smart ones), so their bags have to be removed. One hour later, another announcement, as anticipated, crew is about to time out, solution is that we fly to MKE and change crew there (assured that there will be fresh crew in MKE - right). But then there is too much fuel on the plane, as it was meant to be a transatlantic flight. So have to remove some fuel in order to fly to MKE. An hour later, why have we not moved and why has air conditioning on the plane been turned off? They can’t figure out how to remove the excess fuel and turned off air conditioning to facilitate the removal but forgot to turn it back on! So around 9:00pm, rumors start circulating amongst the crew and those standing at the open door and gangway that the flight might be cancelled. At this point, that almost sounds like a blessing. By the time the announcement is made at 9:30pm that the flight is being cancelled, many of those in the know have already left the plane. So a mad rush to get off the plane and get rebooked and situated for the night. At time of rebooking they assure us that the same flight will be OK to go the next day at noon. Put you up at a hotel and here is a $15 meal voucher. Since its 10:00pm already, not a lot open at the airport to get a meal at. But weary and blurry-eyed, we are thankful for anything. Next day, refreshed for a night’s sleep and hopeful to finally get out of SEA, arrive at the airport again, go through the same drill, get through security, great, flight is still on time, go get coffee and walk to gate. Fellow passenger stops me mid-way to gate and tells me don’t bother, the flight has been cancelled again! Go to customer service and try to get rebooked. Get to customer service and line is a mile long and not moving. Opt to jump on the phone and try to get a flight. Lady on the phone rebooks me on a flight SEA-MSP-AMS-SVO. That’s one more leg than I’d like but heck, get me out of SEA! It is now 11:26am, the flight to MSP is scheduled to depart at 11:30am from a gate that I have to take an airport train to get to. Booking agent assures me that the departure time is actually 11:50am so I have time. Finally get rebooked, rush to gate. Get there at 11:32am. Gate has closed! Gate agent firmly states that flight was scheduled for 11:30, I am late and doors are closed. At this point, I am near tears. How do I get out of this airport??

I selected the vegetarian option on the food which was a cannelloni with goat cheese on a bed of spinach, a very bland and uncooked dish, the bottom half of the pasta was dry and hard there was a sprinkle of marinara sauce - not even enough to taste let alone to moisturize the pasta.

There were pillows, blankets and bottled water at every seat in first class. On time departure and arrival.

Delta Air Lines,8,Alek Perovic,7th September 2015,"There have been a lot of negative comments of Delta Air Lines business Elite seats and I initially thought of them as being overly critical, until I had a first hand experience on my recent flight from JFK to Moscow. The seats are narrow, but so are many other airlines. What I liked was the configuration with single seats in a zigzag pattern on either side of the plane giving privacy to single travelers. Not much storage space, though. It's the tunnel like part of the pod where one's legs go in when the seat is in full flat position. The space is so confined that it's impossible to keep the feet straight up, forcing a person to lie on one's back only, unable to bend knees, requiring a contortionist skills to attempt sleeping on the side. The feeling is actually of being forced into a very narrow coffin. I honestly could never imagine being so uncomfortable and claustrophobic on a plane. I wonder if anyone at Delta actually tested the seats before installing them, certainly would fire those responsible for the decision!

The second flight was better. The seats were spacious, the flight attendants were friendly, and best of all, my seat reclined.

Online check in did not allow seat allocation as system not available. Staff friendly, food good all considered. On enquiring why we were seated separately we were told because we booked online via a travel agent. I have travelled with many major airlines and have never had this problem. Coming back we checked in online. All okay, phone call automated saying flight was delayed 30 mins, no problem but at check in we were told that our flight was for the next day?

When we arrived at the correct gate with 7 minutes to spare, they had already closed the plane doors and were preparing to take-off. I had to make a huge scene in order for them to re-open the plane doors and let us on the flight. They finally did once I brought up that we were not late and that they were leaving early.

No over the head earphones so my husband who uses a hearing aid and only has hearing in one ear could not use the entertainment system at all. The entertainment systems were very small and some touch screens didn't work very well. Mine kept blinking on and off every two seconds which made watching a film difficult. The plane was freezing cold to the point where both me and my husband were physically shivering and it meant we could not sleep on the 9 hour journey at all. We alerted staff of our discomfort several times but they ignored us and the temperature stayed the same. On the shorter flights (3 hours Seattle to Minneappolis) there are entertainment systems but you have to pay $2 for headsets to use them. We tried to purchase a snackbox on board, but they wouldn't accept cash and would only accept card, which would have meant our bank charging us fees. Despite having only one hour changeover to check in for our next flight and go through security at Seattle, we got on the flight, but the airline managed to fail to send our bags, meaning we got them 26 hours after we should on arriving home.

Things got worse from there. When asked what I wanted to eat the choice was steak or lasagne. I asked what came with the steak and was asked what I meant. I said I meant what comes with the steak? Not a difficult question I thought. So the FA goes back to the galley (I could see it all happen from my seat), opens a foil tray and comes back to my seat with one word - carrots! Talk about taking care of the customers. Eventually when my food arrived, sauce had been spilled all over and somehow under the tray. Not sure if this was intentional or not, but needless to say I didn't eat it! I've seen this kind of behavior before when FA's seem to vent on a customer for unknown reasons - I guess I drew the short straw on this flight.

The bad: old planes, hard seats in business, small AVOD screens, dirty toilets, captains constantly using toilets in business class so passengers are blocked, mediocre food. On top of this, baggage snafu in ATL caused my travel partner and I to miss our connection on the way to RDU and they would not put us on the next available flight until I threw a fit. That's customer service in the US. You have to behave badly to be treated well. I'm considering the hot Japanese carriers on my next trip where I know the food and seats are superior.

Due to mileage reasons, we had to fly Delta though we usually fly Alaska. When we arrived at the airport and checked in at the Delta front desk to check our bags, they're seemed to be a bit of confusion regarding our 3 hour layover in San Jose. However, the lady at the desk assured us that everything was cleared up and our bags would make it on the plane with us. After a 3 hour flight delay and having to get off the plane because a flight attendant got injured, we finally took off, barely making our connecting flight in San Jose (we landed at 6.10, got off at 6.20 and our flight was taking off at 6.35). We had to sprint to our connecting flight. After arriving in Hawaii, our bags never arrived at baggage claim. We weren't too concerned at first, thinking that the bags probably just didn't make our connecting flight in San Jose but would be sent over shortly after. After waiting for the next flight arriving from Seattle to see if our bags came on that flight, they never did. Long story short, we ended up never getting our bags until 4 days after arriving in Hawaii.

Departure from LAX was delayed one hour. On board the seat was filthy, seat pocket full of dirty napkins and plastic from the previous flight. The fast turn around in LA obviously did not include a cleaning of the cabin. Cabin crew seemed very inexperienced. Only one flight attendant serving first. Took meal and drink order one at a time, then went back and very slowly prepared it. I cannot say she was rude, but she was not pleasant either. Just robotic in her job. No offer of second drinks, or any ongoing service for the rest of the flight. She just stood in the galley, playing with her phone. When we were close to descent for Vancouver, I asked her if we were going to receive any arrival documentation for customs. She replied, ""oh yeah, I forgot about that!"" She and her coworker than proceeded to distribute the forms as we began our descent. Arrived in Vancouver about 45 minutes late. All in all, the fare was cheap, but so was the service.

Delta Air Lines,2,Judika Chaba,15th August 2015,"First we flew LAX to Savannah via Atlanta. The plane was late every step of the way. My twin 9 year olds and I were going for a small vacation, then to pick up a dog in Valdosta, GA and back home to LA. The LAX personnel with only one exceptional woman were surly and unhelpful. Because I was picking up a dog on the way back, I couldn't pick up my boarding pass electronically. The lines for help were long and the electronic rejection gave no answer. I tried to get help from 3 different Delta personnel, these were women who were recounting their evenings the night before and had no desire and felt no need to interrupt their gossip with work. Finally I found a friendly face among in the Delta line-up and this woman helped. The air crew was surly. Didn't think it was their job to help put up a bag. Turned up her little nose when my son asked for a drink. Atlanta to Savannah they held us on the tarmac 2 hours. Horrible. The way back was even worse. They were nice enough in Valdosta - which is so tiny they sort of have to be - nevertheless they body-searched an 80 year old woman in security. As usual the plane was delayed at Atlanta. Here there was no help available once you got there. Surly personnel. As a Amex Platinum card carrier, I was told I had the right to use the Delta Lounge. Since I was carrying a puppy and had my boys, we went to the lounge. The rude pretentiousness was shocking, and they refused to let us in the lounge. I called Amex and filed a protest and they called - but at that point I'd seen the pitiful offerings and decided to take the kids to PF Changs. The flight to LA was delayed 1.5 hours. When I got to the gate, I asked the girl at the desk what time the plane would actually board. The rude young women snapped at m: ""I just said that it would be in 1/2 an hour..."" I answered her: Obviously I just got here and didn't hear you or I wouldn't ask. Really, Delta? This is who you consider an appropriate employee? That's professional? Other passengers were complaining about her and about her male cohort. To board the plane it was complete chaos. Like being in a Third World country with a free-for-all at boarding - starting from the front rather than the back - so there is the inevitable bottleneck, and no clear instructions anyway. Again the flight crew think they're above helping with a bag. They're too busy to bring a meal mid-flight - for a child! Surliness, snootiness. Bad attitude. I thought United was bad.

I go to Japan a lot and I'm used to stellar Japanese service, so I never had high hopes for service, but cabin crew were a little rude at times. I left a drink for them to collect and they were saying something like ""It seems like a waste"" and then took the drink. Not that I could finish it because it was right before landing. Very cold plane in my view. Seats were okay and IFE was okay. Dinner was regular but breakfast was terrible. The egg and sausage looked and tasted worse than a fast food restaurant. I could not get a return flight for a good price, and I don't know about other airlines, but when I changed my flight for a second time due to illness, they charged you 4k or more just for economy.

Comfort+ had very nice legroom and very good seat width. The long haul flight from Detroit to Amsterdam was flown with a 767-400, which is in my opinion the nicest plane that Delta flies. With a 2-3-2 layout and me traveling in a party of 3 made it so we traveled in the middle section and were still undisturbed by an extra person next to us. It made the entire flight feel a whole lot more private. The IFE systems were great and had plenty of movies to watch. Were left on time and arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule. This made it super easy to catch my connection. At Amsterdam we had plenty of time to relax and explore the airport.

Delta agent in PAP was very helpful and put me on the flight I asked for, then Delta bumped me up to Business (Delta One). The new Delta BC with lie flat seat is really good. Window seats are even isolated (no passenger on the side). It is surrounded by the next seat which makes it a rather personal space. Having typically a low expectation of American carriers, the upgraded Delta BC is surprisingly good. Dinner is simple and well presented, service is quick and just what you need for a 7-8 hours flight. Connecting flight was slightly delayed but transit in ATL, is actually relatively easy and straight forward (from flight A to B in less than 15 min). I know it's no Asian carrier quality, but it is definitely changing my perception of US carrier and Delta seems on the right track to lift up its service. Will probably fly them again.

Delta Air Lines,3,Rosemary Westgarth,21st July 2015,"We'd already flown Delta NYC to Nashville and were happy with it for shorter flights. However we were unhappy with business class Atlanta to London. It was either stiflingly hot or freezing cold. The seats were meant to lie flat and the advertising shows a woman lying on her side on the flattened seat. Interestingly she is a petite woman as anyone of average size would only be able to lie on their back when the seats are reclined as the legs are enclosed by the seat in front. My husband (who luckily likes to sleep on his back) and I swapped seats half way through as my seat was faulty and would not recline at all but I was still unable to sleep because of the seat configuration. I am a woman of average size. When my husband took it over he fiddled to see if he could get it a bit better and succeeded in releasing the leg rest which then became stuck so he spent the rest of the flight bolt upright with semi-raised legs even for landing! The two younger female flight attendants were pleasant and tried to help but the older chief stewardess for Business was curt and initially asked me what I had done to the seat! As there were no spare seats in business and no first class section she was unable to re-seat me. They tried manually fixing it and re-setting the seat, remotely, electronically but didn't return to see if it had worked - I had to call them again - and and finally (after 30 minutes of wrangling with it) the head stewardess said the magic words ""sorry about this"" (the one and only apology). Really she couldn't have cared less and when she handed out mints at the end of the flight she didn't ask how it had gone or apologise again. The food was very poor for business class (compared to BA for instance) and my husband's gluten free food was functional mainly consisting of fruit especially melon though his chicken main course was actually better than my standard meal. Breakfast consisted of granola (so sweet it was horrible) or eggs and he got a dry bread roll which was unheated (most gluten free bread is only palatable when heated) and a very poor quality gf sausage. There is such a huge range of gluten free foods now that it seems as if the airline's caterers are just not trying. Food was certainly no better than economy and fell short of Virgin Premium Economy which we flew out with.

Pathetic customer is service - it consisted of blaming the tower and pushing back the departure time every 15 minutes with full confidence that it would leave then. Well, it didn't. Eventually they got a a new plane and it left 2.5 hours late. I had a connection flight that I missed as a result.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to New York City,July 2015,1,1,,,1,1,no

Thanks to Delta, my wife and I have to sleep in a really nasty hotel room somewhere in nowhere Detroit because they were unwilling to help put us up for the night. Their advice was to take the Sky Miles packs and spend the night in the airport. Thanks for the toothbrush. Help with my luggage? Nope! We don't recommend trying to get your luggage off whatever belt it may have been diverted too. Help with a room? Nope. Take your travel kits and be on your way!

Delta Air Lines,8,A Wilson,14th July 2015,"BOS-CDG, overnight flight on the 11th July and code-shared with Air France. Check-in was done via the Fly Delta app and was simple enough, paid an extra £50 for exit row seats which I am conflicted about. On the one hand, a good investment to have some comfort (nobody thrusting their seat into your lap on a red eye) and it's good to be able to stake a claim to those seats without relying on luck, on the other hand they were right next to the bathroom so had to deal with people standing between my seat and the wall all night and there was also nowhere to store my bag. Boarding took a little longer than expected due to a group of very excitable French children coming home from a summer camp. They were very loud, boisterous and actually downright rude but the excellent crew put a quick stop to their antics once they were on the plane. Otherwise there were no delays. The flight itself was exemplary, the staff were attentive and wonderful. The entertainment system is well-stocked and of good quality, I also loved the genuinely entertaining and funny safety video. The food was adequate, although I wasn't a fan of the meagre breakfast. No complementary alcohol on a long-haul also struck me as a little stingy. Overall I'm pleased with my experience and would recommend Delta to others.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,BOS to CDG,July 2015,4,4,3,4,5,5,yes

Waited on the taxiway for 20 minutes prior to takeoff, allegedly due to a stoppage at Laguardia, the connecting city. One bathroom on the plane, which was dirty. Arrived at Laguardia a tad late, but not so late as to miss the connection. Then we sat on the taxiway at Laguardia for an hour because our gate was occupied, and missed our connection to Halifax. Now stuck in Laguardia from 11:30 am until 6:10 pm, arriving Nova Scotia at 9:30 pm. Half a day of vacation blown. Laguardia has nothing to do inside the airport. Delta refuses to comp anything. This was not a weather delay. We are traveling with a couple who are Delta premium members. They went to the customer service desk in the private Skyclub to try to get something in the way of a comp.

I was notified by emaila phone call and through the app that my flight was delayed. Within one click of the app, I was offered alternate flights, even alternate dates and airports without any extra charge. I was then rebooked to the nonstop flight departing an hour later but two hours earlier than I originally would have arrived. The agent at the SkyClub upgraded me to an exit row seat free of charge and apologized for the delay, which was minimal in the first place. The delay was handled extremely smoothly and I was rebooked, upgraded and taken care off within five minutes. The actual flight was good, on board a Boeing 737-900ER and despite being only a year old, the cabin was not properly cleaned and there was garbage on the seats. Legroom was excellent as there was no seat in front of me, although it was a bit hard to see the television - it was about six feet away, although DL was smart enough to put a remote control for these seats. Complimentary beverage served multiple times and buy onboard food options were decent. Flight attendants did their job, were quite friendly. Entertainment options excellent, with entire seasons of my favorite TV shows. WiFi was fast, although I recommend buying the 24-hour pass on the DL website or app as it's much more expensive onboard.

We were told that the plane was supposed to arrive to Philly airport around 8am, making its departure to JFK at 8.40am.

Delta Air Lines,9,Juan Eukel,9th July 2015,"AUS-LAX-SEA. I usually fly economy but decided to spring for first class as my traveling companion had never flown in that cabin before. It was nice to check bags with no fees! Boarding was efficient in AUS and it was a nice touch to be addressed by name. Boarding efficient and flight left on time. It was also nice to be offered a pre flight beverage, chose white wine served in a plastic cup. The first class bulkhead seats we had were spacious. Embraer 175s do not have ovens so lunch was a cold chicken orzo salad with an appetizer and desert served all at once. Many reviews indicate that crew was either rude or inattentive but my experience wasn't like that. The drinks were kept filled during the flight, food ample and tasty and the flight attendants were upbeat and social. Boarding in LAX was a mess as the gate was in the corner and no one listens when they tell you they board by zone. Once on board a pre flight beverage was offered and after take off they served dinner. On the LAX to SEA route, Delta has partnered with Luvo as part of upgrading food service in first class. The wrap and accompaniments were fresh and delicious. Drinks flowed and attendants were offered snacks and checked on customer needs.

There was very little seating and the place was cramped. Good thing we only had to be there for an hour. The SEA to MSP leg was on an older 767 with upgraded interior. This was the domestic version so first class was billed as business and the seats was packed in a bit tight. In any case, once again, we had a great experience. Pre-flight drinks and lunch were served. My companion and I had the cheese burger with dill potato salad, sliced cheese with fruit and a piece of raspberry cheese cake all served at once. For a lunch, it was rather hearty and was very filling. The flight attendant was a bit stuffy but she kept the drinks coming and was still attentive. Gin and tonics I had were strong so I limited myself to two and then switched to white wine. The MSP to AUS was just as pleasant. My companion had the ginger beef and I had rice with shrimp and sausage. Again a slightly stuffy attendant but nothing to get into a fuss about. Seats had ample space and the aircraft, though a bit old but was clean. One negative thing that was consistent on both the AUS-LAX-SEA and SEA-MSP-AUS flight was trash in the seat pockets.

Gate Agents need to enforce bag sizes and the number of bags people try to drag on.",B757,Solo Leisure,First Class,MSP to SJC,June 2015,4,5,4,,4,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,Lionel Wilkinson,18th June 2015,"I took my second trip with Delta and I must say I was definitely not disappointed. I flew with Delta last year and felt there was no need to change to a different airline. I flew from Indy to Phoenix via Minneapolis. The crews both at the gate and during the flight were professional and respectful. The big two thumbs I want to give is on my luggage in Phoenix. No sooner had I walked off the plane and down to the baggage claim carousel was I greeted by my bag arriving. Only thing I found average was the seat comfort, but granted I have never really cared about seat comfort.",A319 & MD-90,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Phoenix via Minneapolis,June 2015,3,5,5,,5,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,Brian Smith,17th June 2015,"For a short haul flight like this one (7-8 hours each way), I try and save money by not booking business class, rather ""economy comfort"" on Delta. As usual, the service is perfunctory, the food not bad in and out of Narita, the seat fairly comfortable, and the entertainment of good quality with lots of choices. No drama on either flight. My only complaint that has never been addressed properly with Delta over the years is the horrible state of the lavatories. They are always left to fester for entire flights. I have never once seen an FA go in one to clean one. Delta is not ""special"" compared to other international carriers, but it's adequate and they have treated me well in the Skymiles program so far.",777-200,Business,Premium Economy,NRT to NRT via SIN,June 2015,4,3,4,5,5,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,Gaspard Smith-vaniz,14th June 2015,"Check in procedure was ok but slow. The flight was nice, with very good in-flight entertainment, and the flight attendants were very nice.

Delta Air Lines,3,Ineke Litjens,11th June 2015,"Brussels to JFK. Horrible check-in procedure. Unable to check in online, then checked in at airport but without assigned seat. Result: sitting separate from my boyfriend while I am afraid to fly. At check in counter not very helpful, lady (though friendly) said she couldn't do anything and that we had to wait until boarding. At gate itself they're trying to get us to sit next to each other but difficulties since flight is fully booked. Not impressed with customer service and we were not informed by email, when booking, or at check-in that there were paid seats as an option and that the free seats were given away and that is why we were assigned no seat number.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to JFK,,3,3,2,2,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,10,Paul Monkhouse,6th June 2015,Delta will always be my first choice across the Atlantic and I have found them to be always even better than either BA or Virgin (who have themselves always provided excellent service). My latest flights were no exception. This is the second time I've flown from Heathrow to LAX in four months and both times the service has been great. Without doubt the friendliest cabin crew I have met the in-flight entertainment was good the food was okay and plentiful and the drinks and snacks kept coming. My first choice every time and whilst not the cheapest carrier it's certainly been the most reliable and pleasant to fly with.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,4,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,S Cheney,6th June 2015,5/28/15 PVD-ATL-CAE 6/1/15 CAE-ATL-PVD. Flight was on time departing PVD. Had booked Economy+ and was lucky enough to have an empty middle seat. Got a free cocktail in Economy+. Unfortunately passengers ignore the signs that say bin space over those seats is reserved for Economy+ because when I boarded I had to use a bin 4 rows back which is annoying when deplaning. Got delayed about 25 minutes by weather before landing at ATL. Had to go straight to the gate for the next flight. Staff was very pleasant. ATL to CAE is less than 30 mins so there is no beverage service. Arrived at CAE about 50 mins before my scheduled flight from CAE to LGA. Got a text saying it was delayed 45 mins. I knew I would never make the connection to BOS. There was a flight boarding to ATL and I asked if they could get me there faster. They said they couldn't get me to BOS earlier but they could get me to PVD. They gave me a seat (and happily changed it when I asked for an aisle). No beverage service. CAE to ATL is killer at 7am! No Starbucks in Terminal C at ATL. Flight to PVD arrived 20 mins early and flight attendants were very pleasant.,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,5,F Naylor,4th June 2015,JFK to LAX. We were apprehensive about flying Delta but got a good price on this mid afternoon flight.

Overall an ok experience.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,2,1,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,3,Michael Kallay,1st June 2015,$600 for the less than 2 hour flight 1377 (PHL-RDW) booked 2 weeks in advance was daylight robbery.

Delta Air Lines,,Julia Mulligan,1st June 2015,I have chosen Delta for years because of it was the best one but lately it's service has been so terrible that I will never fly with them again. Twice now I have flown out of Detroit and there have been problems that have delayed the flight to our next location (I understand that problems happen) but while we were on our flight I was very thirsty and asked the stewardess for a glass of water and she said the cart would be by shortly - the cart skipped our whole section and when I tried to stop the flight attendant again I was ignored - I didn't see the attendants for the rest of the flight. When we arrived at Atlanta to switch to our next flight we had missed our flight. The first time no one would help me - I must have talked to at least 10 people before finding someone that rudely told me to go to a certain gate and wait and that I might make it onto that flight. This time I went to the gate and they told us the plane had just left (the plane was not suppose to leave Atlanta until 12.50 I was at the gate at 12.40) and when I asked where do I go to get another flight I was ignored and they walked away. I then went to the information and was told to go to a gate that had no one at it - no one! I then went back and was rudely sent to another gate where I was told they didn't know if they had a seat available for me. After an hour I was able to get a flight home. I could not believe the rudeness that I was treated with.,,,Business Class,,,4,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,1,E Cooley,31st May 2015,My wife and I were booked on Delta flight 7 leaving Dubai at 9.45 pm. There was a mechanical problem with the plane these things happen. We were advised to go wait in a nearby Business Class lounge and wait for an announcement which never occurred. I walked back to the gate only to then discover that the flight had been cancelled and no announcement had been made the gate agent even admitted this. The rebooking was a nightmare we finally left Dubai two days later and had to endure the same rude gate agents who were more concerned with talking on their cell phones and playing around than taking care of the customers. Most of the agents did not speak even a small amount of English they were not organized and clearly not professionals. I have flown with Delta for over 11 years this is the worst experience I have ever had.,,,Business Class,,,4,1,4,4,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,A Snyder,31st May 2015,Worst airline I have ever flown. We are frequent flyers and this was a trip from hell. We will never fly Delta again. We were traveling from LAX to Dublin with a change of planes in N.Y. We sat in the plane on the ground for 2 hours at L.A.X. because of mechanical problems. Because of this we missed our connection to Dublin so had to spend the night in N.Y. From N.Y. They flew us to Atlanta the next day. Again there was airplane problems. We waited for two hours at the airport for them to find a plane that worked. It took us two days to get to Dublin. On the way home we flew from Dublin to N.Y. again sat on ground for 2 hours and 15 minutes on the Tarmac. Once we arrived back at LAX waited another hour in baggage claim only to find that our one bag was put on another flight.,,,Business Class,,,3,4,3,3,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,2,T Lovett,29th May 2015,We booked first class seating for the midnight to dawn flight from LAX (USA) to (SJO) San Jose Costa Rica so we would have lay flat seats and a good LAX lounge to use while we waited for our midnight flight. The seats did not lay flat. Delta cabin staff explained that lay flat seats are only available on First Class international flights over water. Obviously Delta executives do not regard a 5 hour overnight flight to another country as an international flight. The safety briefing was a screen based childish cartoon. The First Class cabin was old and tired. There was an unfinished soft drink bottle in my seat pocket. There was no inflight magazine for my seat. Upon requesting one I was handed a creased and folded one by a surly female cabin attendant. The Delta lounge in LAX was dirty and unkempt. Complementary drinks were limited to Bud Beer or a house white/red - anything else had to be paid for. Food was mixed nuts or pretzels. Undoubtedly the second worst flight I had the displeasure to undertake. The worst flight was the return from SJO to LAX. It compromised all the above plus the following. Upon taking our seat we were offered a glass of sparkling wine. Take off was delayed for 40min while a seat was repaired. We asked for a second glass of wine to while away the tarmac delay and was told that they only had one bottle for the flight and they had already used it. Classy eh? On arrival at LAX our priority First Class luggage was one of the last off - so much for the priority tag. I can only wonder how well Delta aircraft are maintained if this is their penny pinching standard in First Class. My view is that one should avoid Delta at all costs.,,,First Class,,,1,2,1,3,,1,no

We booked first class seating for the midnight to dawn flight from LAX (USA) to (SJO) San Jose Costa Rica so we would have layflat seats and a good LAX lounge to use while we waited for our midnight flight. The seats did not lay flat. Delta cabin staff explained that layflat seats are only available on First Class international flights over water. Obviously Delta executives do not regard a 5 hour overnight flight to another country as an international flight even though some of it was across the Pacific Ocean. The safety briefing was a screen based childish cartoon. Flight safety is serious business. A safety briefing by a cabin attendant reinforces that. Downplay it with a cartoon gives the impression that its all one big joke. The First Class cabin was old and tired. There was an unfinished soft drink bottle in my seat pocket. There was no inflight magazine for my seat. Upon requesting one I was handed a creased and folded one by a surly female cabin attendant. The Delta lounge in LAX was dirty and unkempt.

No IFE on the inbound flights but because I had a tablet I just connected to their wifi (without paying) and go to Delta Studio allowing me to stream movies for free. On the return flight the B737-800 was newly refurbished and had IFE with some good choice of videos. Snacks (to be purchased) are as usual awful. Flight crew polite and professional except the on the MSP-PDX leg where two flight attendants were more preoccupied by taking breaks than serving beverage in a professional manner. No delays on all segments.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,3,J Roach,28th May 2015,Looked forward to Delta Comfort on recent flight from DFW to Minn. Delta changed planes so there was no Delta Comfort. I was relegated to a window seat. Delta could not get their act together on reassigning seats so the boarding process was terribly slow and disorganized. I fly Delta to Minn because I have to not because I want to. I don't think American's customer service or organization is great but it's better than this. If you can use another airline.,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,3,1,,3,no

Delta Air Lines,2,Joel Costi,25th May 2015,DL2311 on May 2nd 2015. JFK-MIA lounge with very poor. Some snacks some drinks but you have to pay if you want by example a bottle beer.

Delta Air Lines,,R Stanley,20th May 2015,"We could have driven From Louisville to Portland ME quicker than Delta was able to get us there after they had a plane changed at a gate in SDF due to a ""bathroom"" issue and difficulty finding the flight crew that apparently wandered off and could not be found for a while.",,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,6,A Bastien,20th May 2015,5/0/15 PHL-SLC Airbus A320. Flight similar to the ones I took on 5/4/15. Economy comfort is better than economy but not by much. Its main advantage is priority boarding which allows me to avoid the inevitable rush and scramble for overhead bin space. Rated food as 1 because I didn't buy any entertainment also as 1 because there wasn't any. I don't look forward to flying with Delta even in economy comfort.,,,Premium Economy,,,3,3,3,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,6,A Bastien,20th May 2015,5/4/15 MSP-PHL MD 90. Rated food as a 1 because the inflight offerings do not appeal to me. When I've tried to purchase food items on previous flights the FAs have run out of the items I would have ordered. So I brought my own sandwich. I also brought my own beverage because FAs on a previous flight refused to sell me a bottle of wine for dinner told me to wait for the beverage cart's second round. Rated entertainment as 1 because there was none. The FAs were competent the aircraft clean and on time.,,,Premium Economy,,,3,3,2,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,6,A Bastien,20th May 2015,5/4/15 SMF-MSP Airbus A320 Economy Comfort legroom adequate service competent. Complaint: Delta does not post economy comfort fares on its website but as separate upgrades for each flight segment. Value for money rated at 1 because I traveled on an award ticket entertainment rated as 1 because the flight didn't have any. Legroom was slightly better than on previous Economy Comfort flights but recline was still minimal. Food for purchase was unappealing but the complimentary snacks and beverages were acceptable. I wouldn't recommend Delta because it seems to focus more on nickel and diming its passengers than in providing quality service.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,C Wallace,20th May 2015,A simple flight from BWI to NYC turned into a 3 hour wait on flight 3371. With very little communication between the staff/pilot and the passengers. On a bright sunny day in MD and only mild rain and overcast in NYC the pilot said it was weather related. After waiting for the plane to arrive for 2.5 hours. When we get on the flight we had to wait another 30 minutes on the plane for more ridiculous reasons - they claim the baggage door was not shut properly. So someone comes to shut it and then we go out to runway. Then we have to wait another 13 minutes. Not able to rebook me for reasons that were also very vague. The flight was overpriced and didn't event accomplish it's intended purpose to get people where they need to be on time. As a business traveller this is absolutely unacceptable. I cannot get business done if I can't get to my destination.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,2,A Bastien,20th May 2015,5/9/15 SLC-SMF Airbus A320. My spouse let me sit in her first class seat. It was a disappointment: legroom not much better than Economy Comfort although the seat was wider and had more recline. The food was also disappointing same snacks as the ones given to Economy Comfort passengers. On the positive side the FA brought me a glass of wine when requested unlike my main cabin experiences in which FAs will not bring me a small bottle for wine (even if purchased) until the beverage cart makes its rounds. I didn't pay for this first class travel but if I had I would have been even more disappointed. My trip satisfaction is less than it was for my Economy Comfort flights because first class failed to meet my expectations. I rated entertainment as 1 because there wasn't any.,,,First Class,,,4,4,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,7,R Knecht,20th May 2015,LAX-JFK-KEF return Comfort + on all four segments. The Sky Priority boarding and extra legroom were a real plus but the DL Comfort + seating does not compare to BA Premium Economy. The Levo wraps and frozen yoghurt bars on the two transcontinental flights were 100 times better than the coach dinner and lunch served on the two international segments. Appreciated the open bar on all four flights but not the wine from a box on JFK-KEF. The cabin crews were friendly and professional on all four flights and there was no wait for luggage in either KEF or LAX. The ancient 767 on the final JFK-LAX leg was too warm had poor ventilation and the VOD lacked the live Dish TV option. Boarding for JFK-LAX was chaotic.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,3,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,5,L Sun,18th May 2015,Flew DL1162 LAX-JFK on 05/11. We were booked on this flight after missing connecting QF flight from MEL. I was seated in an aisle seat next to the emergency exit plenty of legroom possibly the most comfortable seat I've been on (having only flown economy). The snacks and drinks were fine the cabin crew were attentive. However it is simply wrong that you cannot use the entertainment system during take-off and landing. Overall quite average service nothing particularly bad however I still would prefer QF if I had the choice.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,3,2,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,L Lander,12th May 2015,On 28 April 2015 my friend and I travelled from Fort Lauderdale Florida to Atlanta Georgia for our connecting flight to Manchester England UK. Due to storms in Florida our flight was delayed by an hour. Despite the pilot's best efforts we arrived at Atlanta B24 35 mins before our flight to England was due to take off. After running as fast as we could we arrived at the check-in desk 10 mins before the Virgin plane was due to depart (the airline was aware of the Florida delay). Despite the best efforts of all the personnel on duty they were unable to get us on the plane. Nevertheless not only did the staff stay with us to locate our baggage at B24 but tried and succeeded to get us on another plane to depart that night. Staff not only located our baggage but ensured it would be put on the new flight.

My wife and myself travel from DUB 3 or 4 times a year always with Delta to enjoy the Florida sunshine. We do on occasions treat ourselves to a trip up front and to a degree we are looking forward to the trip already booked for the end of Sept when we are using some of my wife's miles to upgrade.

Delta Air Lines,3,F Eliadis,22nd April 2015,"We flew to Phoenix from Montreal with a Detroit connection and cannot believe what is passing for a decent airline experience in the US these days (the return on American Airlines was just as bad). The least passengers should expect from an airline is a seat that is not torn and filthy a plane that leaves on time and that arrives on one piece. Fine the flight did those things but are we supposed to be impressed? The plane was packed and tiny. No room for hand luggage for many passengers. Old plane - I mean really old. No movies or Ipads. Somewhat encouraged by the Wifi on board until we discovered you had to pay for it and it did not work well anyway. Business class looked like economy class five to seven years ago. Seats were small and do not get me started on the pitch. Dilapidated and depressing two other words starting with ""D"". Delta needs a makeover.

Delta Air Lines,9,Katherine Berich,20th April 2015,Travelled from London Heathrow to Los Angeles in early April 2015. From the time of check-in the Delta staff were nothing but extremely helpful and obliging making the process super quick and easy. The flight itself was fantastic - unlimited drinks/alcohol (I had three very generous servings of red wine) and ample food. Hot towels were handed out at the beginning and end of the service while two meals were served during the 11-hour flight. If we required more drinks or food the staff were more than happy to oblige. The in-flight entertainment was also top notch - wonderfully wide selection of television shows and films. All in all a very pleasant experience - can't say the same for the subsequent LA > Vegas leg of the journey so will be sticking with Delta for intercontinental flights!,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,5,,5,yes

Flight left 35 minutes late with no explanations. Although skypriority boarding was smooth the welcome sparkling wine was warm. No peanuts not even a napkin.

Awful dirty DL Skyclub at terminal 4 wherein all drinks and food have to be paid for except for mediocre house wines warm domestic beers and yes popcorn. Flight left 30 minutes late. Rude disinterested crew barely greeted the boarding passengers. Same ancient 757 with fairly comfortable lie flat seating. Were served an awful breakfast at midnight instead of dinner with no explanations. Then crew gathered in the front galley screaming and laughing bothering paying J class passengers that were trying to sleep. One of the pilots occupied seat 1A beside me without even saying hello. Unbelievable. Finally the crew forgot customs forms to entry BOG they didn't even knew they existed so we had to get them upon arrival. Luggage arrived one hour after arrival. Never again.,,,Business Class,,,3,1,1,2,,1,no

Inflight food and drinks good considering it's a 2hr regional flight crew very polite and friendly. AVOD is amazing with lots latest movies.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,2,W Rongu,14th April 2015,I flew Business on an international flight aboard 767-300. The experience in the Business class is probably one of the worst due to the layout of the cabin. The Galley is in the front and in order for the flight attendants to service the plane down to the middle of the standard economy class they must go through the Business class cabin to reach the areas to the back. On other airlines such as ANA they have an extra Galley behind the Business and Premium Economy class seats so that there may be a separation in service and noise. The design of the seating arrangement in the Business class is much tighter in the Delta with its bulky boxy full-flat system that the flight attendants' hard foot steps with their high-heels can be felt bouncing through the walls of the full-flat system. What kind of flooring did they use in the aisle? Why do the horrible footsteps and cart sounds transmit so much to the boxy seat system? I could not rest quietly or comfortably as the massive loud obnoxious footsteps of passengers and flight attendants alike can be felt all throughout the flight. No courtesy there obviously no company policy there obviously to make the flight attendants wear something more quiet on their feet or to be more considerate when running down the aisle! The temperature control of the full-flat system is lacking. The seats themselves feel fine but they become very hot after a while and there is no air around the seat or your feet so there is no way to cool down. The attitude of the flight attendants is about what you would expect from a classless American transport company fairly lacking in manners and they treat you as if you're on a flying bus (as they have always done). The Flight Safety video is a joke as they intended it to be but it certainly doesn't make anybody feel safe as nobody remembers the actual safety bits but remembers the comedy bits! A total waste of time and energy and most certainly conveys what I said earlier about the attitude of the airline. It feels like a cheap low-class flying commuter bus service and they'll treat you like that.,,,Business Class,,,2,2,2,3,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,,David Kaiser,14th April 2015,"My wife and I returned to Boston on Saturday from my son's wedding in New Orleans. I had booked Delta to and from New Orleans changing at Atlanta. On the way down a problem emerged. My wife generally signs everything Patti instead of Patricia. I had made the reservation for her for Patti as I always do. A TSA guy decided to make an issue of the difference between Patti (on the boarding pass) and Patricia (on her license) and sent her back to the Delta counter. They changed the boarding pass and all was well. We reached the airport in plenty of time Saturday morning in NO and tried to get everything done at curbside check-in. I got my boarding pass but the machine refused to give out hers. The guy checked the bag and turned us over to a Delta guy walking the floor inside. He put us in a large line for ""special problems."" Since at this time there was about an hour before boarding we weren't worried. However Delta was woefully understaffed the line moved with glacial speed. With about 20 minutes to departure my wife told me to board to make sure at least one of us got home and I did. Meanwhile I was in touch with my wife via cell she had finally reached the end of the line. They told her she was too late to make the plane. They told her she would be on the next flight to Atlanta and there was 20 minutes between its landing and our Boston flight departing so she might make it. Her seat of course had been given away. It turned out the name confusion was an issue again. I will never fly Delta again if I can possibly avoid it.",,,Economy Class,,,4,1,2,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,8,Kevin Tunnicliffe,14th April 2015,First time with Delta and very pleased with the result. Seat on the 767 worked fine if slowly and the flat bed was comfortable. This was enhanced by the excellent Westin pillow and duvet. The most comfortable pillow of any airline I have flown with. Food was excellent well presented and flavourful. Cabin crew were pleasant attentive and polite. The only bad thing I can report was the IFE system. It took five or maybe six attempts to make it work and the selection of movies was extremely limited. The small screen was not of great quality either. Flight was on time.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,2,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,7,L Michael,12th April 2015,JFK-NRT-SIN And back. Sky club at JFK was nice but wish food didn't need to be paid for. First flight was largely uneventful the seats were what I expected food was nothing special and IFE was great. The lounge in NRT though needs an upgrade in terms of F&B. A lot of other airlines have more than just small bowls of whatever they're serving. (At least there were showers). NRT-SIN was normal and like the previous flight. The return was similar aside from the fact that Delta actually listened to customer feedback and pushed the departure time from 6 to 7am. Not too thrilled that the arrival into JFK is when a bunch of others come in and result in a 2 hour wait at immigration.,,,Premium Economy,,,3,3,3,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,C Haynie,12th April 2015,I arrived at the airport around 8.50 for a 10.15 flight. I was on military orders. They delayed my flight and/or switched my flight 10 times. Put me on Standby on 3 different flights. They gave no preference or concern. I called to talk to customer service and they did nothing. During my flight from Jacksonville to Atlanta they didn't even serve food or drinks because they said they ran out of time. I could have driven from Jacksonville to Norfolk faster. I was in the airport for 14 hours. That is unacceptable and the staff won't tell you if you made standby or not so you have to wait there instead of getting food or leave the area.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,1,M Trotter,12th April 2015,JFK to LHR possibly the worst flight and service I have experienced. The cabin crew made it clear that passengers were especially economy were a real inconvenience - the customer service was awful food and beverages dumped on trays and very little interest in the passengers. There was no excuse everyone was polite to the cabin staff and if anything had kicked off it would have been as a result of their rudeness and failure to pay attention. Economy doesn't mean cheap had I been travelling alone I would have travel business but as I was with a group I stayed with them. Compared to Virgin Atlantic and BA Delta is a waste of money will always change the flight or choose another carrier in future once was too much.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,3,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,8,E Dethier,12th April 2015,Flew DL from Brussels to Sacramento CA. It turned out to be a really good trip. All flights were on time and connections went smooth. Both ground and inflight staff were very professional and friendly. The special meal I ordered was fine. I would definitely recommend this airline!,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,4,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,M Mark,12th April 2015,I flew from BNA-ATL-EYW round trip for spring break. Full planes no upgrades available. Its nice to take a full size plane into Key West. All four flight segments were nice clean comfortable. Seat was tight but its coach and no flight was over 1.5 hours. Flight attendants were competent and pleasant on all legs. Loved the gate crew at Key West campy and competent. Made everyone laugh. Easiest way to Key West in my opinion. It wasn't cheap and my Frequent Flyer miles were no good for a First Class upgrade but I didn't mind a single bit.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,Perry Amy,6th April 2015,LHR-JFK 29th March 2015 - B767-400 - Boarding was slow at Heathrow but very organised we had a basic economy seat on our outbound sector and I've never seen Seats so small my partner is 6ft 6 and could not fit in the seats and although everyone is entitled to someone even had the audacity to recline their seat in front of him knowing he couldn't fit. Flight was full but the services offered were very good and efficient we were offered a complimentary meal and a snack during the flight along with beverages. Flight attendants were very nice and polite however a couple of them were miserable and rude and towards the end of flight they lost interest and almost threw the coffee at us. We were happy to get off the flight it was very uncomfortable. JFK-LHR B767-300 - Our inbound sector was much better we paid to upgrade into economy comfort with exits seats which also meant priority boarding. Seats were not the greatest but legroom was huge and better for my partner. Flight was a night flight and it was very quiet and almost empty flight attendants polite and services offered again were very good. Both aircraft each way were ageing but at least they got us to our destination. I noticed Call bells were not answered and were left for hours. In flight entertainment was good new films offered for free along with games and TV shows. I would recommend Delta but next time would definitely pay to upgrade both ways due to the seat pitch in basic economy.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,5,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,L Iakovidi,6th April 2015,Economy Nice Côte d'Azur to JFK 4th April 2015. Flight was about an hour delayed to leave Nice airport but Delta gave all passengers complimentary pizza and drinks as an apology for the wait (even though I had received an email about the delay several hours before). Boarding took forever as the mandatory checks have become very long and tedious (my carry on bags were opened for a second time right before I boarded the plane although this was randomized from what I understand). The plane floors and loos were quite dirty as if a thorough cleaning had not been done in a while. Very limited food choices although staff helpful with snacks. Other than above (oh and the horrendous immigration queues at JFK) everything else was great.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,1,R Allen,28th March 2015,"DL28 Atlanta-Heathrow 16/3/15. Party of 4. Paid $99 upgrade to premium economy (drinks and seating package). We were offered 2 drinks and noticed all economy passengers were offered same FOC. There was little or no discernible difference between our seats and other seats in economy cabin. We were given the wrong food which was awful. The video equipment failed and it took almost 1 hr. to effect a reset. Hostess never did respond to call had to walk up the plane to report video and food issues. Generally a ""could not be bothered"" attitude.",,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,9,Tait Steve,28th March 2015,Flew Business from BOS to AMS in late February. The newly configured Business cabin on the A330 is now my favorite on any airline or any plane. Very comfortable seat/lie flat bed and personal space. I was traveling with my husband and unlike many other configurations the two middle seats allow two passengers traveling together to actually be together. The food and wine are excellent as usual and the IFE is industry leading. Let me not forget to praise the huge monitor for the IFE. Much larger than other airline's. Delta Business is my preferred airline for international travel. The only areas where they fall a bit short are in the crew professionalism at times. For instance on this flight I was never referred to by name which is just lazy. I just have one other comment and that is I wish they didn't serve a bag of spiced nuts with the first cocktail and instead served something like hot nuts or chips in a dish instead of a bag. Just a little thing but the only are a that isn't top-notch.,,,Business Class,,,5,4,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,E Simon,26th March 2015,BOS-LAX 738. Boarding was fairly efficient. They boarded basically by two zones after all the preferred boarding for the first/frequent flyer/credit card holders etc. I'm not a fan of the zones as you're always stuck behind someone but at least they turned back people who tried boarding out of their group. They advertise the flight with seatback entertainment on their site but I noticed after booking they often switch to a plane with dropdown monitors. On this flight it switched to an aircraft with dropdowns which actually was not as bad as I thought but not thrilled with how they do that. The overhead monitor showed the latest 'Hunger Games' movie and then the 'Minions' movie which is as good as I would have got with Live TV on the seatbacks. The monitors seem to be every 3/4 rows. They gave nuts/pretzels out twice during the flight which is not bad for legacy carrier and drinks twice. Price was comparable/just below other offerings and at the most convenient times. It arrived early to LAX and had no wait on takeoff due to mid-morning time slot. Middle seat of my row was empty with aided in comfort. 8/10.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,,C Trahan,25th March 2015,"Flying from LaGuardia to Dallas the flight was cancelled without the airline letting us know then they had no flights for 10 hours from NYC to Dallas. Really? Not even a connection out of their home town of Atlanta. No apologies no sympathy just the typical ""welcome to New York"" chuckle. You would think the airline could have tried to help my family and me for at least 10 minutes without a sarcastic ""sorry but it could be worse!""",,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,1,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,5,S Rappaport,25th March 2015,Generally I like Delta airlines however they need to have the staff designing connection between small and large airports try to make those flights when the weather isn't perfect. I have had numerous bad experiences connecting between Madison WI and Detroit MI on my way to Boston. I have had to run from one end of DTW to the other end change terminals i.e. run from B to A. I am a Medallion level passenger. Delta needs to work with the Detroit Metro Airport to get connecting flights closer together.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,2,E Blatt,23rd March 2015,I used to recommend flying Delta to friends and family. I fly very often and they used to do a great job. This past time while flying they disregarded the seats that I had chosen and put me in the very back row on all of my flights. I get very bad anxiety back there and was very unhappy with this. When I kindly and calmly asked them about this they told me that you now need to pay extra in order to choose a seat ahead of time. Flights are already starting to cost a lot more so there is no way that I am going to pay extra for a seat every time that I fly. I will never fly Delta again as long as they operate this way.,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,2,2,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,,Paul Brault,20th March 2015,Never again with Delta. My wife and I experienced delays after delays yesterday March 18 at JFK after our flight to Montreal got delayed several times. It took us from 11.30 to 00.30 the next day to get from Fort Lauderdale to Montreal with a connection at JFK.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,C Page-Hellas,20th March 2015,6th April KL6149 Schiphol to JFK. Very poor service on a transatlantic flight. Plane was loaded when staff knew there was a technical problem which resulted in us being sat on the tarmac for 2 hours. Inflight entertainment was poor (some of it was chargeable). Food provided was poor quality and tasteless. Staff were not very pleasant or personable. This was a very poor experience which I will not be repeating!,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,Melissa Carson,19th March 2015,I will never book with them again. I am currently stranded in Seattle with my 3 children who I had booked to fly as unaccompanied minors. We called to book their flights and were assured that everything was in order. After a 5 hour drive to the airport today we were told that they could not go on their flight because it was the last flight of the day out of their connecting city. Even after calling twice to confirm everything before we left! We were offered nothing more than an insincere apology. It's like they didn't even care. What pathetic customer service. Will never fly with this airline.,,,Economy Class,,,,2,,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,9,N Wade,17th March 2015,I was aboard a 767 from MSP to LAS (economy class) and a 757 from LAS to MSP (first class). Flight attendants were friendly and planes were clean and seemed well maintained. On time departures with easy and smooth landings and take offs.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,Daniel Glesby,17th March 2015,YWG-MSP-PHX. Flew YWG-MSP on a CRJ-900. I was on the 1 seat side rather than the 2 seat side so I had both a window and an aisle seat. Flight attendant was friendly and frequently came by with snacks and refills. MSP-PHX was on an A320. A little disappointing that the A320's don't have seatback TV's seat was comfortable and on par with every other airlines First Class on A320's. Flight attendant was also friendly and efficient. Food was fine (I had soup sandwich and chips). Same as the first flight she was came by frequently with snacks and refills. For some reason on the YWG-PHX route Delta's First Class is only $75 more than Economy. Delta is now my preferred airline out of Winnipeg and in my opinion is better than Westjet which I flew home.,,,First Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,,R Irwin,17th March 2015,"Flew DC to Albuquerque with connection through Atlanta. Arrived in Atlanta followed display boards for departing gate. Got to the gate 90 minutes before departure confirmed gate location was correct and sat down. Sat 10' from the counter the whole time and looked out the window. Thought it was strange the plane hadn't arrived yet and they hadn't made any announcements. Gate Agents were busy issuing Delta Dollars to a bunch of passengers from last flight so the area was very busy. Turned around and happened to see on the reader board along the wall (not behind the gate) that there was a gate change. No announcement was ever made in that terminal that the gate had changed and there was no announcement with out names to go to the gate. It was moved from B28 to B3 literally as far apart as you could get from each other. By the time we got to B3 the door had closed. We found a ""red coat"" employee across the hall. She made it seem like we were idiots and there would have been announcements made. She put us on Stand By from Atlanta to Salt Lake City we had 3 shots to get on one of the flights. However it is spring break and Salt Lake is a huge destination point all flights were oversold and had 30+ people on standby for each flight. In the hustle to get from one location to the other and going to 3 different terminals we saw numerous reader boards that indicated gate changes and while sitting in those 3 different terminals we never heard one announcement for any gate change on a Delta flight. We finally had to buy tickets on Southwest so we could get home. While sitting in their terminal we heard announcements for gate changes over and over and they were paging passengers to check in at the gate. I will never fly Delta again.",,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,9,Jenner Erik,17th March 2015,CDG to ORD March 3 and one week later back both flights leaved on time plenty of food decent inflight entertainment with a great choice of international movies would fly them again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,A Stanton,9th March 2015,"This is my first experience flying with Delta and I am extremely disappointed. My flight was canceled over 20 hours in advance and I was automatically reassigned to a flight departing 13 hours later. While I appreciate a seat at some point their were 6 flights earlier that I could have been placed on and I was not given a choice. I called Delta and had an associate inform me that I was ""not a priority"" because other flights before mine had been canceled. She also told me my departure weather was the issue she was incorrect. She did absolutely nothing to help me on the phone and was unapologetic. My co-workers on other airlines all departed mostly on time and make it to the same destination I was heading just fine while Delta continued to tell me the weather was not ok. I arrived at the airport at 5am and proceeded to sit in standby flight after flight. As I sit and wait for these flights they are all overbooked by at least 15 seats and I have had several agents act that I am an annoyance when I asked to be put on standby. The attitudes of the agents are generally distasteful and rude. They are treating us as if we are creating the issues and I have offered no apologies on behalf of anyone.",,,Business Class,,,3,1,3,3,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,E Berman,9th March 2015,On March 1 2015 my flight from Phoenix to JFK (1247) was delayed due to icy conditions in New York. My 2pm flight finally took off at 4pm. When we were an hour from our destination the pilot informed us that management was diverting our plane to Detroit. We were told that agents would be waiting for us at the arrival gate and would answer all our questions. The agents turned out to be one very disinterested agent who was talking on his cell phone when we arrived and only told us where to go for re-ticketing when prodded. He sent us to gate A53 that already had a line of 150 people when those of us in the back of our plane got there. There was a lone agent to answer all our questions and re-book each person individually. After 1 hour in line we hadn't moved at all. There were no announcements no accommodations no compassion or concern for your customers. No food no pillows no answers! Many of us had family back at JFK waiting for us and we had no information to give. That none of the 1200 people that were diverted lost it is a testament to OUR understanding and patience. Clearly the understanding was one-sided. No one blamed the inconvenience on the airline after all weather happens. What we objected to was the total ineptitude and lack of compassion of the Delta personnel. Eventually a fellow came around with one slice of pizza but I found out about that by roaming the gates looking for information. Most of us slept on the floor as there were no cots or sleeping bags given as an option. It is disappointing that Delta couldn't do better. Eventually some of us received a $100 voucher by insisting on some compensation for our discomfort. I don't imagine I will make much use of it as Delta will be a last choice of airline for me.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,2,3,,4,no
Delta Air Lines,9,M Bernstein,9th March 2015,Delta recently on a finally two class plane from YWG-MSP (CRJ-900) I believe. Total trip was YWG-MSP-LAS. I despise the United ERJ-145's and similar small product that was on international routes from YWG previously. Thank you to Delta for slightly upgrading the size of your planes out to MSP. Solid 757-300 economy plus to Las Vegas. Solid crew everything was nice and smooth. The 757 had been refurbished had a great AVOD system. Flights on time crew very friendly. I cannot ask for more on this route. It seems to me Delta is making a large effort to improve their customer service and technology and overall experience. It is working wonders it is amazing how far ahead Delta is of United (my other carrier to Las Vegas through DEN). My preferred US carrier.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,,G Lonergan,4th March 2015,I managed to get back home 43 hours after I left my hotel to get my flight from NY JFK to Dublin. Given no explanation left standing in several queues for hours with refreshments only given hours later. When people in the queue started giving out as nobody had given any information or updates a Delta employee got the police. I'll go via Aer Lingus in future as I know they would not treat people like that. The flight return was maybe 15 euros cheaper but what a mistake it was.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,3,3,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,Calvin Watkins,4th March 2015,I will never fly Delta again. My wife and I were scheduled to fly out of Atlanta to Wilmington and were made to check our carry on bags at the ramp 15 minutes later we were deplaned. We had just waited 45 minutes in the terminal for a flight crew. They board us and tell us weather stopped the flight. Don't insult our intelligence. That plane sat in my view for 4 hours and we were refused our luggage. 24 hours later no one at Delta knows where our bags are. We re-routed to OAJ customer service in Atlanta assured us they where re-routed. This was totally avoidable.,,,Economy Class,,,,1,2,,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,,M D Sperry,4th March 2015,In early August 2014 I booked a Business Elite ticket from STT to ATL for February 22 2015. My confirmation indicated my seat number and that a meal was included in my ticket. At check-in however I found that Delta had changed my status to Economy with a seat far back in the aircraft. When I called Delta to rectify the situation I and my Son-in-law were both treated rudely. We spent 2 hours on the phone with the result being that I should “ request to be upgraded at the airport. At the airport there was another 30 minute wait before I could talk to a Delta representative only to learn that I'd have to appeal at the boarding desk. A one hour wait ensued at the head of the line at the departure desk while the Delta representative ignored me waited on other people and fiddled with a computer terminal that wasn't working. The end result was the same rudeness and no help at all. I got neither the meal nor the priority baggage check-in that I had paid for. The flight was late arriving in ATL and I had to run to make my connecting flight to BOS. Delta had changed my seat assignment on this flight also. When I called to file a complaint the Delta Supervisor informed me that Delta changes aircraft seat assignments and passenger status without notifying passengers and confirmed that they had sold my assigned seats to more than one person and that these were normal”practices for Delta. I can't imagine why anyone would want to fly with Delta Airlines. Once they have your money they treat you like dirt or worse. There are plenty of other carriers out there. Based on this experience I can't see myself ever flying Delta again. I know I am not alone as there were at least 20 people in line behind me with similar complaints.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,3,2,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,A Garry,4th March 2015,Left at the airport in Jamaica for 7.5 hours only to be told the flight was cancelled. Now at 11pm we needed to find our luggage go through the process of finding hotel reservations along with 100 other passengers. The next direct flight home to NYC was in two days. The following morning Delta tells us that our flight leaves in 40 minutes. Now we need to pack and get to the airport fast. We flew business elite and it was so disturbing to find that the armrest was broken and that no wifi or TV. Our choice of meal was eggs or cereal? Should have gone coach. The flight was not cheap and expected more. Realizing now why Delta is not our normal choice of airlines.,,,Business Class,,,2,5,2,1,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,9,Monkhouse Paul,4th March 2015,Superb flight very helpful cabin crew who couldn't do enough for the passengers and were very friendly. Food good and plentiful as were the drinks. My first time flying with Delta and a very positive experience. Will be booking with them again rather than their partners Virgin who I found (unusually) a little disappointing on the flight home.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,S Sulkes,24th February 2015,12 hour flight TLV-JFK was excellent because of the crew. Upbeat polite couldn't do enough. Economy seating was fine and 3-3-3 configuration on 777 aircraft is very liveable for that duration. Dinner followed by as many sandwiches peanuts and pretzels as you can eat and as much as many beverages as you like all served with a smile both on request and on cabin pass throughs. Crew on this trip had seniority (I asked) and these were folks who understood the profession of customer service. Video on demand is top in class. A grade. Minus 1 point for lavatories that could have been kept a bit tidier for this long of a flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,John Smith,24th February 2015,We were traveling with a 10 month old infant. We were connecting flights at St Paul Airport to Kansas City. Our flight was supposed to depart at 7.35 pm. When we got to the gate we were told the flight was delayed for 2 hours. What amazed me was that the plane was at gate. When we asked then why the delay we were told that because there was no pilot available. Now we are getting stuck with our baby girl in the airport for 2 hours when we had no baby food left. No more Delta for me!,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,2,2,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,6,M Woods,24th February 2015,SJU-JFK in Economy Comfort seats. Late night flight out of SJU. Crew were fine. Economy Comfort seats had adequate legroom - glad we paid for the extra room because regular coach seats looked like torture for tall people. In flight entertainment though was terrible. Tiny overhead movie screens. I thought Delta had all seat back video screens. I would have been really annoyed had I spent the money to sit in First - those seats were not so much better than Econ Comfort and the same tiny overhead movie screens every few rows. We were handed a tiny roll with some cheese and turkey and a Milky Way with the beverage service. It was not a memorable flight and on this route JetBlue still wins every time.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,1,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,,Chad LaCour,24th February 2015,Flew from baton Rouge to Orlando Florida via Atlanta. What a mistake! Delayed on our outbound flight to Orlando by more than 5 hours. Delayed on our I bound flight by more than 3 hours. I will never fly Delta again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,2,4,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,3,S Letellier,18th February 2015,Flew NYC-CDG via DTW on Delta. The positive point is I was upgraded to First Class on the US journey but this isn't worth it you only can drink whatever alcohol you like. Seats were uncomfortable on the over-atlantic flight staff rather impolite and not caring at all. Arrived on time. Food was not satisfying not tasty. Entertainment is to my eyes the only interesting point on Delta. Too expensive for so low standards.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,2,4,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,7,Brian Smith,18th February 2015,NRT-PDX-NRT in Premium Economy. I'm a frequent flyer with Delta but usually fly in business class. Going to Portland the food was far superior to the food on the return I'm certain it is because of the high level of catering here at NRT. On the return the amount of food was not good either and there was no food available in the galley. I had to beg to get peanuts and it seemed like I was getting a big favor from the FA (hello 10-hour flight no snack besides ice cream). The seat has enough legroom has a recline that doesn't interfere with the person behind you too much except for making the AV angle uncomfortable to watch for the one behind. Great AVOD which is Delta's selling point in economy. FAs pleasant but not overly so-just doing their job. The toilets were not cleaned throughout the flight. They were stocked with paper products but never once cleaned and trash was overflowing. It was bearable but not enjoyable overall. Hard to come down from business class with a lie-flat seat and good food.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,M Campbell,18th February 2015,MAN-AMS-EWR EWR-ATL-MAN. Flights all left on time. Nice FA's. Regular drink/bar service. Nice that you get a bottle of water each. Main issue was that seats were uncomfortable on the flights to NY and back from Atlanta. Flights on these were on old 25 year planes and you felt it.,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,4,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,E Schuchardt,11th February 2015,I flew Delta from St. Louis to Las Vegas via Minneapolis. All four legs left and arrived about on time. The planes MD-90 and 757 we're clean and comfortable. All four of my flights had wifi. The flight attendants were friendly and offered a small snack on the longer legs. The pilots made announcements as appropriate. I will fly Delta again if given the choice.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,M Chowdhury,11th February 2015,LCA-AMS-EWR and EWR-CDG-LCA. Flights on time overall good service. Food drinks and entertainment was good. On return flight was bit delayed because of snow and baggage arrived day after because of handling issues at the transit on French airport (CDG).,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,Eduardo Pinzon,11th February 2015,Flew from BOS to DFW via CVG January 23rd. Very good experience small aircraft both legs but clean I was in Economy Comfort. Flight attendants very good with excellent customer service. From CVG to DFW the flight was delayed due maintenance but it was repaired and the flight went without any issues. Arriving in Dallas just some minutes late but the baggage service was very good and the bags were out quickly. My return flight was DFW to BOS via ATL January 29th also very good planes were full both legs. I didn't get economy comfort on DFW-ATL but paid $19 for a preferred seat I think it was not a good idea since got group 2 and almost didn't get space for my carry-on because group 1 passengers almost got it all. I think if you are paying something extra for a seat you should go on group 1 despite that the flight was very good and the flight attendants were ok. The leg from ATL- BOS was very nice I got Economy Comfort flight attendants very professional and cool both flights departed and arrived on time.,,,Premium Economy,,,5,5,4,1,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,6,Gerasenkov Andrey,11th February 2015,LGA-BNA operated by Endeavour Air on Jan 30th. Aircraft - 2 week old CRJ900. Departed 2 hours late due to the plane arriving late and the crew attempting (unsuccessfully) to fix a broken overhead bin lock. Eventually they gave up and scotch-taped the bin cover so it wouldn't open during the flight. Otherwise the flight was uneventful and fairly comfortable. Snacks and soft drinks were distributed and the FA's were attentive. My return flight from BNA got cancelled due to LGA completely shutting down due to the winter storm on Feb 2nd so I got rerouted to JFK via ATL. The 40-minute flight from BNA to ATL was uneventful and was on a completely full 23.5 y.o. A320. No food or drink service on this short flight. The ATL-JFK eventually departed 3 hours late despite most other JFK-bound domestic flight cancelled. The MD88 was completely full which was understandable given that the three previous flights to JFK were cancelled that day. Despite its age the aircraft was comfortable and the flight smooth. Upon landing in JFK we had to wait another 1.5 hours on the taxiway for a gate to become available. Bottom line: Delta got me back home albeit 8 hours late but I think that's pretty good given the circumstances.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,P Kiss,11th February 2015,Flew LAX-YVR with Delta. My first time with Delta and I was impressed. Took a 6am flight so I was at the airport at around 4am but the staff was present and was able to lift my mood even without my morning coffee. Barely a wait for security or bag check. When I got to my gate the flight crew was already there and chatting with travellers. Boarding was quick. Unfortunately there was a slight delay due to 'mechanical failure' but I still arrived on time. FA were excellent with 3 drink services (I think) and offering coffee and water in-between. I slept about 1.5 hrs out of the three hour flight comfortably due to the lovely headrests that adjust in multiple ways. Didn't try to recline my chair however.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,Conyers Russell,11th February 2015,Suffering from a sinus/head cold I was not anticipating my return from LAX-JFK-BDA on a red eye. My flight was scheduled to depart LAX at 9.40pm and I checked in at Delta's Priority counter around 8:00pm and proceeded quite quickly thru security and found my way to a very crowded SkyClub. When we boarded the aircraft I was pleased to discover that this plane was a newly converted B-767 with the new Business Elite product-proceeding to my seat my coat was stowed and I was served champagne in a champagne glass (so unlike American who still give you those tacky plastic cups) for a pre-flight drink. The seat was 4A and quite comfortable and reclined to a full lie flat bed a nice pillow and quilted blanket as well as an amenity kit. As soon as we were air borne I changed into pajamas and slept most of the way to JFK. The crew were quite keen to help as were the nice ladies in JFK SkyClub during my transit time for BDA. The JFK-BDA flight was also very pleasant although I slept on that one also. All in all a very nice experience with Delta on this route especially with the new Biz Elite product between LAX and JFK-will look forward to doing it again.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,4,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,K Clark,6th February 2015,LAX-JFK-Zurich 24th Dec 2014. Return Jan 7th 2015. First leg of the flight came in late so we missed our connecting flight. They scheduled everyone who missed the connection on the same flight a few hours later ensuring it was busting to capacity. No seats unused. Even though I get airsick and need to be next to the window they refused to accommodate-even though I'd paid more for a window seat on the flight their delay made me miss. Then later delayed on the runway 4 hours-apparently because they were waiting for a manifest. The seats were just atrocious. I've flown economy all my life and never felt so uncomfortable. I will do anything to never have to fly this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,J Elsmore,28th January 2015,Traveled home from New York to Heathrow on 18/1/15 on Delta Airlines at 7pm flight DL401 with my Husband and three friends and our complaint is that the Stewards and the Stewardesses were totally ignorant and only spoke when asking us what we wanted (food and drink). They did not interact with the passengers at all and the food was almost thrown at us this was our first flight with Delta and it will be our last.,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,4,5,,4,no
Delta Air Lines,,Ashley Gerig,28th January 2015,My daughter just flew in from Miami they cancelled hundreds of flights because of the incoming storm however they chose not to cancel hers took off 1 hour 15 minutes late. Landed 2 hours 15 minutes late diverted from LaGuardia to JFK shuttle service to LaGuardia was cancelled due to weather and they literally left their customers stranded with no way to retrieve their vehicles to get home. My daughter is currently stranded. This flight should have been cancelled as were all other flights.,,,Economy Class,,,,2,3,3,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,9,R Maccuswell,26th January 2015,"Philly Atlanta Sarasota and back. Out was an MD88 and MD90. Had a bad ankle. Gate agents allowed early boarding on both flights. FAs all friendly. Basic service no complaints. All flights all on time aircraft clean and plenty of room at 5' 10"". Return was MD90 and a 757. Again friendly gate agents and FAs flights all on time and overall good service. As an AE platinum card holder got free checked bag each way.",,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,M Attayee,23rd January 2015,Flew SYD-DCA via JFK and return from DCA-SYD via LAX. Both flights were really good. Very friendly cabin crew and individual greetings by the captain. Food was average plane food with 3 meal services from the SYD to LAX and LAX to SYD. I would definitely fly Delta again great service good clean aircraft and also a wide range of inflight entertainment.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,N Stepp,23rd January 2015,Columbus (CMH) to Managua Nicaragua and back. Personally I felt that Delta delivered an enjoyable experience and I would gladly travel with them again. 1) My initial flight from CMH to Atlanta went well. We left and arrived on time. The plane itself was clean and neat and seats were surprisingly comfortable although my shoulders could have used a little more room. Flight staff were courteous and even though we were on a booked flight I felt comfortable. 2) We experienced over a one hour delay from Atlanta to Managua and had to wait in the plane for about 45 minutes because of traffic over Florida (not Delta's fault). This plane was not nearly as nice as the first (no seat dividers) but the staff were friendly and the flight was still enjoyable. I flied in the Economy class upon my arriving flight. On the way from Managua to Columbus: 1) I flew in the business class cabin and was immediately greeted by friendly staff who were eager to give me whatever drink I desired. The seats were very comfortable and a delicious meal was served. The flight both left and arrived on time. 2) After arriving back in Atlanta we were greeted by an insanely long line to pass through customs. I don't know how much influence Delta had but I had a two hour lay over and just barely made it to my next flight. For the flight from Atlanta to Columbus I flew in the first class cabin which was surprisingly less comfortable than the business class one that I had been in previously. I slept for the majority of the time but was still given good customer service and the flight both left and arrived on time. After this experience I would recommend Delta but would suggest that you have at least a two hour layover to prevent any problems with connecting to another flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,3,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,Stephanie Stewart,21st January 2015,I booked two round trip flights from Houston to Lagos Nigeria. The first leg of the first flight was in October 2014. On this leg I flew business class and the flight was comfortable and very pleasant. The return trips to Houston 2014 in December and to Lagos in January 2015 were a totally different story. I flew economy on these flights. The seats were terribly uncomfortable (even though I was in economy comfort) and the conditions were deplorable. By the end of the flight bathrooms were indescribable! There was all sorts of trash and food in the aisles were the passengers had apparently not taken the time to throw their refuse away. I have never had such a miserable experience.,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,2,2,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,9,N Hartmann,19th January 2015,We flew TUS-ATL-EVV on the way EVV-DTW-ATL-TUS on the way back. We have two kids and traveling is not always easy. But Delta did a fine job of making things smoother for us by letting us board early and treating our kids very well. (They seem to be the only airline that still gives kids their wings). We were delayed getting out of DTW and the pilots openly made an effort to get us to ATL on time recognizing that people had connections to make. They were true to their word taking a shortcut and flying at a higher speed and we arrived in ATL 10 minutes later rather than the 30-40 we expected. The MD-90 we flew between TUS and ATL was brand-new inside and we were impressed by the service we received from the crew. The fact that you get a drink and a snack is nice I know people that fly Delta just for the Biscoff cookies. The planes are for the most in great condition though the Airbus 320 we flew had a few loose tray tables and could stand to be updated. I've been pretty dissatisfied with American airlines except for Southwest but Delta trumps all of them in terms of flight quality service and passenger dedication. One small irritation: some of the in-flight entertainment is pay-per-view.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,Ronald VanDriesen,19th January 2015,Travelled from Detroit to Paris in Business Elite on Delta's Airbus returning from Rome to Atlanta on a B767. To say the least I was extremely pleased on both flights though the 767 was a little tighter in comparison to the B777 and Airbus. Service food were excellent. Delta continues to be my favorite airline.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,5,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,7,S Browning,19th January 2015,Connecting flight was boarding when my first flight was landing. Agent at the desk said she would call through but I had to get from one end of the airport to the other. I am an older person and went as fast as I could. My mouth went sandpaper dry and I felt quite faint only to arrive at the next flight to find the gate closed! It was Deltas fault I was late there should have been plenty of time between flights if they hadn't delayed so long leaving a small airport initially that didn't have a line up of flights going out. They spent too much time deciding whether or not to de-ice the plane! I'm glad they were careful and did it but could have got the job done a lot faster and got the flight in on time. As the plane for my next flight was still there I begged the agent at the adjacent gate to allow me to board as I couldn't spend the night and next morning in Minneapolis waiting for a flight to Newark. Fortunately she co-operated called through and they opened the door to let me on. I felt the stewardess was unfriendly as I boarded the plane probably thinking I should have been there on time. I think in situations like this there should be some pick up at the gate to get you to the next flight without having to nearly make yourself sick to get there and following flights should wait for all booked passengers making connections when Delta has caused the delay. This might have been a one off situation. I usually have found Delta friendly and helpful as the agent was who helped me to get on my flight.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,M Leong,14th January 2015,JFK-NRT-SIN. Lounge at JFK was nice the flight was long and seats were narrow. The food could be improved but then again the catering was from JFK so my expectations weren't high. Crew were fine and overall the flight was good. Wish I used the showers in the NRT lounge as I was in for a longer wait than expected. Departure was pushed back an hour and we waited another hour and a half on the ground due to traffic. The staff handled the delay well and the wait was more comfortable than expected. Landed in SIN at 3am as a result. Still good experience overall.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,1,J Barach,14th January 2015,Horrible experience all around. The priority level ticket agent was not able to find the ticket for our lap child wasting 45 minutes of our time at check-in. When it was finally found on their system they were not able to print it for us. Just very frustrating and stressful. The business class on Delta is laughable. Lets see drop down screens from the ceiling no different than they had in the 1980s. The movie didn't even work on the return flight. Food quality I wouldn't even feed to my dogs. Its pretty bad when you buy a business class ticket and you don't even get a movie on a 5.5 hour flight or a decent meal.,,,Business Class,,,3,4,1,1,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,,M Bachalo,14th January 2015,"My daughter and I traveled from Winnipeg to Basel recently. Our return flight from Paris to Minneapolis was delayed and therefore we had to rush to our connecting flight. Little did we know how far apart the terminals were. Delta staff should have informed us of the distance and offered a passenger trolley. It turned out that as we arrived at our departure gate the information board said ""Boarding"" however the Delta staff person would not let us board. While we waited at least 10 minutes for a supervisor we watched the information change from ""Boarding"" to ""Closed"" and we watched our plane depart without us (along with another passenger in our circumstances). We were booked on another flight seven hours later meal vouchers were denied as we waited the seven hours we saw instances (more than one) where other passengers were allowed to board after the ""Closed"" sign was on. Delta staff were not prepared to assist us in any way nor did they appear to be trained in customer service. This is just one issue albeit the biggest one that we had with Delta personnel giving incorrect information being rude (not the FA - this was all with the staff at the various airports we dealt with). The FA's were wonderful on all flights - perhaps Delta would best be served if they did the training to the airport staff.",,,Economy Class,,,1,1,4,4,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,1,Kyle Slick,14th January 2015,"As a frequent traveler I feel I've coped pretty well with the US Airline ""nickel and dime"" mentality that's resulted in baggage fees exorbitant ticket change fees and the dwindling supply base fare economy class seats (not to mention the dwindling leg room in those seats). Now Delta does not allow seat selection with economy class fares. My company do not allow class upgrades which means I'll forever be the really tall guy stuck in a middle bulkhead seat if I fly Delta. Old planes with no power no in-flight entertainment (it never fails to amaze me how many ancient CRT televisions are still mounted to the roof of Delta cabins). On longer flights Delta refuses to stock enough food to meet the demand of passengers towards the back of the plane. Sure I can survive a 6 hour flight with nothing but peanuts and pretzels but why? The only positive thing I can say about Delta is to give a kudos to the majority of attendants that are willing to put up with grouchy passengers and restrictive rules. The ones that maintain a positive attitude deserve an award.",,,Economy Class,,,1,3,2,1,,1,no

Delta Air Lines,7,N McFadden,11th January 2015,Flew Comfort Economy YYC-HKG return. Booked flight 6 months in advance (and got a great deal) but over the next four months our flight itinerary was changed six times. Since some of the changes impacted our flight by over an hour I called to change to other flights - agents were happy to help out and they answer their phones promptly - a pleasant change compared to the waits we usually experience with our regular airline Air Canada. Alerted by email of all but one of the changes which I noticed by accident. We had paid extra for Comfort Economy and one of the changes meant that the fee for Comfort Economy was higher - instead of notifying us that we needed to pay an extra $20 to keep our Comfort Economy seats they just put us in a regular Economy seat and kept the $130 we'd paid to begin with! Thank goodness I noticed. Flights themselves were good. The extra leg room on the long haul flight was wonderful. Wide selection of entertainment. Plenty of food/drink offered and quality not bad (daytime hot meals ok mid flight snack fine breakfast awful). Service attentive. Very cheerful on the way there and pleasant on the return flight. Connecting flights from Calgary-Seattle were on old planes but fine for a one hour flight - staff were great. I would fly Delta again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,Alex Coias,11th January 2015,LHR-JFK return. I tend to pick Delta due to the affordability and nice service. Again I was not disappointed. Flight going out of London on time and plane not full. Got plenty of space and the food was good. Coming back to London the flight was packed and the plane was slight older however the food and service was good. I asked for a special meal that was accommodated on both flights! Happy to fly Delta again for sure!,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,A Smith,5th January 2015,I flew SFO-LAX on a Delta Shuttle emb-175 in first class seat 4A. The seat cushion was pretty hard but fortunately it was only a 50 minute flight.

Delta Air Lines,10,S Baker,5th January 2015,We flew Delta Airlines 777 business class from LAX to Bangkok (via Narita) in October 2014. The seating configuration is one of the best we have seen internationally. The lie flat seats were enhanced with two pillows and a comforter. The second/smaller pillow worked very well for your legs/knees over the long flight. The comforter was the most enjoyable blanket we have ever experienced on an international trip. It's amazing that such a small difference in quality can make such a large difference in the sleeping comfort and environment. The only complaint about the seat configuration is that it is difficult to communicate with a traveling partner.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,4,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,5,A Bastien,5th January 2015,OKC to ATL then ATL to TPA MD 80 from OKC to ATL then twin engined wide body Boeing from ATL to TPA. Seats on both flights were uncomfortable with minimal recline. The headrest pushes my head forward making it difficult for me to nap. On both flights I forgot to bring my seat to the upright position for landing. The FAs didn't notice or might have figured it didn't make any difference. I would not pay to fly Delta in economy or EC on account of the uncomfortable seats. I traveled on a free ticket purchased by my spouse with FF miles so I gave Delta three stars for Value for Money. Food for purchase but items that appealed to me weren't available. The FAs were courteous the flight uneventful. However Delta is my least-favorite airline.,,,Premium Economy,,,1,4,1,1,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,8,H Christmas,5th January 2015,My flight with Delta was a short 1 hour trip from LAX to SFO. It was unfortunately delayed due to bad weather but the service on the flight definitely made up for this. Drinks peanuts and pretzels were offered soon after departing LAX and a healthy snack box filled with trail mix wholegrain crackers guacamole tomatoes celery and carrots was also provided. I did not expect this to be included in the price at all on such a short flight! After flying with another airline on a domestic US trip the service on Delta definitely stood out and I would definitely fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,,,5,yes

Delta Air Lines,6,G de Domingo,5th January 2015,PDX-AMS-PDX: Flew on economy comfort for both legs. The PDX-AMS was good with the typical Delta service which has improved over the years. Aircraft was clean and a very good IFE. For the return flight it was quite different starting with a very disorganized Delta security at the gate. The contracted agent were borderline rude and did not have a clue what they were doing. During the flight the cabin crew appeared to do a minimal job and could care less about the service and especially the state of sanitary conditions of the restrooms.

Otherwise it's pretty much like other U.S. carriers. Food for purchase. I didn't buy any so rated it at one star. Charge for entertainment headphones didn't buy a set so I also rated entertainment at one star. I fly Delta only because my spouse has Platinum FF status and buys my tickets with her FF miles.

On the way back we flew from Amsterdam to Atlanta the flight got delayed due to bad weather conditions because of that we lost our connecting flight that we can understand what was appalling to us was the rudeness unwillingness to help and basically bad attitude of the flight attendants who are supposedly there to assist you.

Delta Air Lines,4,V Krishna,29th December 2014,Took flight DL403 from JFK to LHR. Bag drop and check in was friendly and fast as was boarding. Seats were leather/plastic and not fabric and felt comfier than many others. Entertainment system was buggy and rebooted once as well as skipping/pausing throughout films. Food was bland but passable: chicken and rice meal with brownie bread and salad for dinner and a croissant with jam for breakfast (with orange juice). Service wasn't that friendly but also the announcements were amateurish with long pauses repeated interruptions and announcing the wrong arrival terminal before later correcting herself! I didn't know until this flight that seat changes within economy class can cost $40 each even if passengers on the same booking were placed in seats far away from each other on different rows (and the seat change was to bring them together).,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,2,2,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,3,A Skidmore,22nd December 2014,GIG-ATL on refurbed 67-300ER (economy) and can honestly say it was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever taken. I am 6'2 and whilst normally I can find airline seats restricting this was the worst I have experienced. I can never before remember having to sit open legged as my knees do not fit in the seat when my legs are side by side including when using budget carriers. What's more the head restraint didn't stay in position making it doubly uncomfortable for a man of my height and despite the seat being in the middle of the plane there was no recline (not that there was any room to recline into). Food was ok drinks only served once despite it being almost a 10 hour flight and the entertainment system had only old movies and the TV box sets were missing random episodes meaning it was difficult to watch anything sequentially. Not a good advert for a Delta and will certainly bare this in mind when it comes to booking again in future.,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,3,2,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,10,C Adams,18th December 2014,"DSM/MSP/LHR 30th November LHR/MSP/DSM 6th December 2014. On all of the flights taken I was treated well by all staff check-in and in-flight. The airplanes were clean even the two short haul flights when the turnaround was very tight. Delta cabin staff are certainly the best by a long mile as compared with the other legacy airline staff in the USA. My flights were a combination of First (internally) and Business (Trans Atlantic). The food on the Trans Atlantic flight was pretty good. My only comment regarding the whole food and beverage service was that the red wine on the LHR/MSP leg was chilled. The equipment used for my Trans Atlantic flight was a 767-400ER which was comfortable (I prefer the Business seating in the 767 as opposed to the A330) and I managed to sleep for 4 hours east bound. Delta are a good airline. People can make or break a business and now it certainly seems that the Delta people will ""make"" the business.",,,Business Class,,,4,5,3,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,Jezrel Sabaduquia,18th December 2014,JFK-ATL-AUS in F. Decided to pay First Class to try their product and Delta has done an excellent job revamping their JFK base. Check-in at the separate Sky Priority area was a top-notch experience it has a completely separate entrance and the area is cozy and classy complete with a seating area and little water bottles at the check in desks. Priority security line was a bonus since it was rush hour and the regular line was just insane. Priority boarding was strictly enforced which was good. Plane to Atlanta on a 757 equipped with the older transcontinental product. Seats were extremely plush and comfortable with great recline and legroom was excellent. Wouldn't mind sitting on those seats on a longer flight. I wish the leg rest would have extended higher though. Breakfast was served which was smoked salmon toasted bagel fresh fruit and yoghurt. I've read positive reviews about Delta's F catering and this was no exception. Everything was fresh presentation was excellent and quantity hit the spot nicely. My only major issue on this flight was the flight lead that served the first cabin he was a tad cold and didn't really interact with the passengers which I admire about US airlines. Service however was efficient and service calls and requests were all honored on a timely fashion. Entertainment system didn't work until half an hour before landing but it wasn't too much of an issue selections for movies shows and music were all great. ATL-AUS on an older 757 seats were huge and comfortable but legroom was limited but still sufficient. Flight attendants were more friendly however only snack options were available despite being a longer flight. Drinks and snacks were provided regularly and were of good quality. Overall Delta is serious about transforming itself as a global airline with a great reputation. All flights were on-time their hard product is reliable catering is excellent and even though I had some issues with service Delta still provided a great flight experience and would not hesitate to fly with them again.,,,First Class,,,5,3,5,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,5,S Paolo,18th December 2014,4/30/14 JFK-LHR was a pleasant experience (evening flight). The Delta Ground Crew were fine but had some issues with regards to an additional carry on item when the Airport Customs denied our entry towards the Immigration Area. Boarded on time on a B767-400ER. Seats felt tight with limited legroom but a very comfortable back rest. Ordered our meals online when booking however my meal was not available on the flight but it was fine to wait for the general food selection. Flight entertainment was excellent getting to watch the latest movie releases of the year. Flight Crew were well accommodated on this full flight. Land safely at LHR with a delay of 50 mins. 5/14/14 Return leg LHR-JFK was a disappointment. The older B767-300 aircraft had a rusty smell. Food selections we chose online were again unavailable. Flight crew were less friendly to passengers fewer smiles yet one of the FAs stood out very well in performance. The seats were a lot of worst with thinner padding making it extremely uncomfortable to lean your back all the way. The restrooms were awful unlike the first leg which was spotless. The same goes with the cleanliness of the cabins. Overall flying with Delta would mean riding old planes and comfort is less of a priority in economy class. Delta is my top choice when flying Domestically but definitely out of the box for international and long haul travel. Next time I travel to Europe BA goes next in the list.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,4,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,3,Ronald Knight,10th December 2014,In March 2014 I booked a flight from San Diego to Vancouver BC. There was a one hour stop-over with plane change at LAX. Between that booking and the flight date of November 30th Delta made 6 changes/cancellations to this single reservation resulting in the change in planes being switched to Seattle with a 4 hour stop-over. When my flight arrived in Seattle a further one hour delay was announced. I asked the reason and was told that it was because of ice despite the fact that it was a sunny day with dry pavement everywhere and the plane was coming from Las Vegas. The clerk then mentioned that Delta did not offer compensation for weather-related delays. The lie about icing was confirmed by another clerk who checked in her computer and found the delay was really caused by mechanical failure. I then asked what compensation Delta would give me for a 5 hour stop-over involving dinner time. I was offered a chocolate bar. Delta is the last airline I would choose in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,2,1,,2,no

I have been carrying-on the same roller bag for the last 8 years. Now they make me check it? I don't get it.

Delta Air Lines,9,Oduche Chuma,4th December 2014,Flew DL from Milan to JFK after arriving on Etihad couldn't wait to see how DL matched up. I was impressed with the level of service from crew bantering with passengers smiling as they went about their duties so eager to serve. The IFE and meals were equally impressive far better than my preceding flight on Etihad flight. This is surely an improvement from the Delta I used to know perhaps the competition is bringing out a different side.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,S Srinivasan,4th December 2014,DFW-ATL-RSW DFW-ATL in Economy Comfort and ATL-RSW in Economy. Checked in online and it took less than 5 minutes to get through DFW security on a Saturday morning. I was greeted by a friendly gate agent who smiled while welcoming me onboard - what a concept for a domestic airline these days. Onboard the FAs were equally pleasant with the First Class FA even offering to hang the coat of an Economy Class passenger. Snack choice consists of peanuts pretzels or Biscoff - while this isn't much it's still more than you get on any other domestic airline. First leg arrived nearly 20 minutes early and the transit in ATL was painless though keep in mind it is a very large airport if you have a tight connection. Boarding was delayed slightly on the second leg to RSW though we pushed back only a few minutes late and arrived 5 minutes early. This flight was not full and the FAs were once again cheerful while performing the beverage service (but only pretzels this time and no Biscoffs). Captains on both legs kept us well-informed with regards to our route and progress speaking to passengers twice on both legs. Overall I couldn't ask for any more from a domestic flight in coach.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,1,Shirley Stewart,4th December 2014,Disappointed traveler. Travelled to Europe via Delta and experience was not good.

Delta Air Lines,8,S Koenig,4th December 2014,GRU-JFK business class JFK-SEA and LAX-ATL in first class ATL-GRU in business class. Biz class in 767-300s was great lie-flat seats. 1-2-1 configuration. First class was standard. 757 for JFK-SEA not spacious but felt roomier than in the domestic 767 from LAX-ATL (2-2-2 in first class). Food on all flights especially the international legs was good. Having priority check-in at LAX was especially welcome as I didn't have to take my bags over to the checked bag x-ray station. I didn't need the allowance of 3 checked bags up to 70 lbs for biz class to Brazil but it can be a plus. Service was good especially on the international legs. We chose Delta because it cost less than American or United for this trip. Delta's requirements for using frequent flyer miles is worse than the others but the flights were very good.,,,Business Class,,,5,4,4,4,,4,yes

Advised that the flight will be full and customers are allowed one personal item and one carry-on bag which must fit within the size check box. My carry-on was approximately 1 inch too wide due to my use of the one inch expansion zipper. So my option was to pay to have my bag checked or to use the other small duffle I had inside of my carry-on. So I basically carried on the same weight of items which now took up twice the amount of room. I understand that there has to be rules but common sense needs to come in to play at some point.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,4,,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,9,M D Neave,1st December 2014,Four flights with Delta LHR-JFK-TPA_ATL-LHR all flights departed on time seats were comfortable and plenty of legroom including the internal flights food typical airline beef chicken or pasta ok and just about edible. Entertainment was very good with large seat back tvs good selection of movies and shows plus a number of games music selection was disappointing and more variety is needed there. Cabin crew worked hard doing numerous drink runs on the international flights beer and wine is free otherwise about $6/7 for internal flights. I like Delta and would fly them in future if their prices remain competitive.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,3,5,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,M Neave,25th November 2014,LHR-JFK-TPA-ATL-LHR. All flights departed on time seats were comfortable with reasonable legroom especially on the internal flight food was typical airline beef or chicken and a pasta on the return leg free beer and wine on the international flights liquor payable by debit or credit card only. Entertainment was very good with seat back large screens and a good selection of movies and TV shows I felt the music selection could be improved by more choice. I have flown Delta 3 times now and find them a good airline and reasonable fares I hope to book my next flights with them.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,Winston Archer,25th November 2014,My wife and I flew first class from Fort Lauderdale to La Guardia on October 27 2014. What a pleasantry that experience was. We flew first class and was extremely pleased with the service and with the attendants courteous manners. The meal we had was hot the drinks were served promptly and we were always asked if there was anything else they could do to ensure us a pleasant flight and comfort.,,,First Class,,,5,5,5,,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,Beverly clark,25th November 2014,"12/3 flight 1215 Boston to Salt Lake City. Flight 1674 Salt Lake City to Portland (Oregon). I flew Delta for the first time traveling in first it will definitely be the last. Completely inattentive flight attendants no personal service of any kind - about the only ""perks"" of first were express lines for security and a mass produced meal. In flight received no attention no offers of anything to drink - in fact felt completely ignored.",,,First Class,,,4,1,3,3,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,,Matthew Smith,25th November 2014,Took Delta flight from Atlanta to Salt Lake City. I have been flying fairly frequent for the last 10 years and this is the worst plane I have ever been on. The flight is just over four hours and the isn't any form of entertainment not even the really old TV's that 25 rows share. I purchased the gogo inflight wifi that cost me $15 for the four hours and it barley has enough speed to check email. You can definitely forget streaming anything or play any game or app that requires the internet. (I tried) The air conditioning was apparently broken as well because it is about 80+ degrees in the plane. Worst flight/plane I have ever been on. I was on more advanced planes 10 years ago. Staff came by one time to offer any drinks or refreshment.,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,2,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,2,Dennis Fakes,25th November 2014,"Flew from Huntsville AL to Atlanta and then to Hong Kong via Seattle. Then returned from Sydney via LAX. On three of the six legs of this trip Delta rearranged our (long in advance) seating. We were notified only once (the night before our morning departure). Supposedly a ""service animal"" was needed in our Economy Comfort seats on the ATL to SEA leg. I understand and accept that. But when we boarded the occupants of the seats we had originally booked the occupants were young and apparently in good heath. No sign of a service animal. I will never again purchase Economy Comfort when it doesn't seem to mean anything and is quite expensive. Also I will do everything I can to not fly Delta in the future. Finally I will tell my story again and again every time I can so that others can be fore-warned.",,,Economy Class,,,2,4,5,3,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,9,M Neave,25th November 2014,LHR-JFK-TPA-ATL-LHR.

Delta Air Lines,5,Aditi Saldanha,20th November 2014,Flown this airline twice from Amsterdam to Detroit and had a terrible experience each time. My flight departing from Amsterdam has always never left on time. Both times my flight was delayed at least 2 hours so in both cases I have missed my onward connecting flight in Detroit. This also resulted in my bag not arriving on time. However apart from the fact that I have never been on a Delta flight that has left or arrived on time the in- flight experience is quite good. Their food is always hot and very tasty they have a good variety in their in flight entertainment and their seats are quite comfy. But due to the fact that I have been delayed and missed my flight so many times because of Delta I will probably never fly them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,5,5,,4,no
Delta Air Lines,10,D Ingenito,20th November 2014,DL836 30 Oct. I fly Delta from HOU-ATL-HNL and return several times each month. I go out of my way to travel through ATL as opposed to DFW on AA or IAH-HNL non-stop on UA. The upgraded A330 cabins with lie flat all-aisle access seats in Business are a refreshing treat from other tired equipment on AA and UA. ATL-HNL is considered an overwater international segment with all the amenities of a transatlantic or transpacific flight. On my recent trip GOGO inflight satellite WIFI was available making a productive business trip in each direction!,,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,M Leong,12th November 2014,BDL-SJC and back via ATL. Coach between BDL and ATL both ways and First between ATL and SJC both ways. First was good unless you are in a bulkhead seat and you are over 6 feet tall. Other than that the aircraft cabin (new 739) was nice and the service was great. Coming back the flight was delayed for an hour which was awful though I slept through the delay. On the bright side I had plenty of time to connect to BDL.,,,First Class,,,4,4,4,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,7,J Hickman,12th November 2014,Flew JFK-SLC 5 November 2014. Flew economy in an exit row. Ok flight but entertainment system did not operate full flight with no place to move to. Seat did not recline. 4.5 hour flight excellent FA but had to pay for food (I declined). On time take off and arrival.,,,Economy Class,,,2,5,3,1,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,J Liu,12th November 2014,"DTW-PEK and PVG-DTW Economy comfort. I must say that I fly transpacific on Delta at least 6 times per year and it has been consistently good each trip. They used tired old 747's and A330's from the old Northwest days but a completely refurbished cabin makes it feel like a new plane. Huge new seatback screens feature USB and charging ports. Delta is making an effort to upgrade economy service on transpacific flights handing out free eyeshades earplugs and greatly improved ""Billboard"" branded earbuds. Delta on Demand has hundreds of movies TV and music choices to keep you occupied on these 14 hour flights. Food service is about the same edible but nothing special. Two hot meals and a mid-flight snack consisting of a sandwich fruit and cookie. Service by veteran flight attendants at the top of the seniority list is pleasant and friendly. Overall it can't compare with the Asian airlines on service but not much to complain about.",,,Premium Economy,,,4,4,3,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,D Mohapatra,12th November 2014,Highly Recommended. Flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. Check-in was smooth and on time departure. Courteous flight crew good food - was too much though and nice comfortable seat. On-time arrival and speedy baggage delivery. Overall outstanding experience and would like to choose Delta for future international trips.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,7,D Parker,11th November 2014,Flew PDX-ATL ATL-CUN CUN-LAX then LAX-PDX. PDX-ATL was very clean on a very well maintained 737-900 attendants accommodated sister's nut allergy made sure no nuts or nut containing items were opened good IFE good wifi. ATL-CUN was disappointing. Attendants were friendly and hilarious but the MD-88 was in decrepit shape with a broken sound system broken lights broken a/c etc. CUN-LAX was a bit better of a plane but not as good of a 737 as the first flight (737-700 i believe slightly unclean and lots of TV's weren't working) and LAX-PDX on the CRJ900 was great. 2 drinks snacks as expected aircraft was very clean and had a brand new feeling.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,3,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,5,J Segel,3rd November 2014,Just leaving Detroit for Boston. Overhead bins are half empty. As usual attendants insist baggage be checked which adds considerable and unnecessary time to trip in Boston. Otherwise adequate trip. Seats fairly squeezed but similar to other legacy airlines. No food or entertainment options.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,1,Tovbin Michael,3rd November 2014,ALB-IAH DL2033/2249. Delta would not let me choose a seat at purchase or check-in. They put me in a middle seat. Now to get out of the seat (into a window seat in the same row) I need to pay them $19. I did not get a fair chance to select a type of seat I wanted even early on in the process. So I am being forced into an uncomfortable seat and into making a payment if I want to fly with more comfort.,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,2,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,1,Edward Mackenzie,31st October 2014,My wife and I were supposed to fly out of Fort Myers on Oct 22/14 after booking our flights two months in advance. When we got to the airport 3 hours before our flight we were told our flight was cancelled and we would have to wait until 8.30 the next day before we could leave. We had to call for a ride ask to stay an additional day - all with no notice! They had all of my contact info and never called. I believe our flight wasn't full so they bumped us to the next morning to fill that flight. This is unacceptable you schedule your flights to fit into your time schedule not theirs. How are you supposed to plan a trip not knowing when they will cancel the flight for no reason do not use Delta if you need to be somewhere on time!,,,Premium Economy,,,1,2,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,9,M Temple,31st October 2014,Was pleasantly surprised by Delta service in Economy class on a round trip between DTW and AMS on Oct. 10 (outbound) and Oct 17 (inbound). Cabin services both ways was attentive throughout the flight - something that some other US-based carriers fail to grasp. The Economy class food was actually tasty and abundant especially on the AMS-DTW flight. Am happy to find a US-based carrier that can hold its own in Economy class against its Euro- competitors. So would definitely recommend Delta service between DTW and AMS as a gateway between the US and Europe - even in Economy the journey is part ot the enjoyment of the overall trip.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,3,A Bastien,28th October 2014,October 17th 2014. Traverse City Michigan (TVC) to DTW DTW-LAX LAX-SMF. TVC-DTW and LAX-SMF on Delta Connection. DTW-LAX on Delta. The FAs on the connection flights were courteous and competent. On Delta after the beverage cart had gone by I asked a passing FA for a second glass of wine. She refused to bring it told me I'd have to wait until the beverage cart returned which was over an hour later. The Economy Comfort seats on Delta were not much better than economy - slightly more legroom but the recline seemed the same. I was unable to sleep because the headrest pushed my head forward. The Economy Comfort seats on the Connection flights felt more comfortable. Delta provided a wide array of entertainment choices. I only fly Delta because my spouse buys my tickets with her frequent flyer miles. I would not recommend Delta for long haul flights on account of the uncomfortable seats. Next time my spouse and I fly to Europe or Asia I will ask her to use her FF miles for flights on a Delta partner with better seats.,,,Premium Economy,,,1,2,3,5,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,3,A Bastien,28th October 2014,10-12-14 SEA-DTW-TVC. SEA-DTW on Delta DTW-TVC on Delta Connection. The blue vinyl seats on Delta were very uncomfortable had minimal legroom and recline the plastic armrests hurt my arms after an hour or so. I was unable to sleep because the headrest pushed my head forward. Seats on Delta Connection were more comfortable. My one star rating is for the Delta seats. I didn't use the inflight entertainment system which appeared to have a good selection. I would not recommend Delta for long haul flights. My spouse purchased my ticket with her frequent flyer miles. Next month when we fly from California to Florida I'll ask her to book our flight on a Delta partner if possible. The Delta seats are too uncomfortable for long haul flights. Same goes for our upcoming trips to Europe and Thailand next year.,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,2,5,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,5,Jean KirschSulllivan,28th October 2014,"In September I flew Delta round trip Detroit - London - Detroit business elite class on planes with the lay-flat seats. Let's be honest and call them ""pods"" not seats. These plastic ""pods"" must be the most uncomfortable cramped seats ever designed for an airplane. I am only 5'1"" weigh 125# and even at that small size I felt wedged into a narrow hard space. Seats are narrow hard moulded vinyl and there is absolutely no room for anything. Couldn't even figure out where to store the provided quilt and pillow. Sit on it? Put it on the floor where it immediately becomes wedged under the seat or you have to walk on it to get out/in your seat? Fold out trays are tiny and almost useless as are the provided ""pockets"" (shallow moulded indents that won't even keep a bottle of water upright) for magazines books papers bottled water etc. Attempting to stand up or leave your seat is a major challenge. Apparently the expected protocol is to wedge yourself into the ""pod"" and not move for eight hours. Never again!",,,Business Class,,,1,5,4,,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,7,Paul O'Neill,22nd October 2014,Flew SYD-LAX 1 Oct and returned 13 Oct - After reading reviews online I was a bits hesitant to fly Delta but was pleasantly surprised by the airline. Found the service to be quite good food had a good variety and all meals were served hot. Also good idea about placing the snacks out for passengers to help themselves. Great choice of movies and TV shows to pass the time. Seats were a little uncomfortable but overall a good experience and would definitely fly Delta again!,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,1,Mike Looney,22nd October 2014,Worst business class I have ever travelled on. The product provided on my trip from LA to San Jose is nothing close to what is represented on the Delta website nor as described in their inflight magazine. We had expectations of lie flat beds on the last leg of our long journey from Melbourne (Australia) to San Jose Costa Rica. To make matters worse this last leg with Delta was an overnight flight - so we had been travelling in excess of 24hrs before boarding Delta. What a disappointment to find we were on possibly the oldest aircraft I have flown it had a 2 person bench seat format with an individual backrest that only slightly reclined. The inflight food service was lousy (very similar to an economy meal on a domestic flight). Then to top it off there was a Dog (yes a canine) sitting / sleeping in seat 1B right next to us! There was no insert entertainment system there was a very old box TV hanging from the ceiling in the aisle which from Seat 1D I couldn't quite see very well.,,,Business Class,,,1,2,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,3,D Wilson,20th October 2014,Went from LAX to Sydney. Staff rude food awful. Only good thing was premium economy seating. The seats were hard - no frills but extra leg room. Worth the difference but would not fly Delta again.,,,Premium Economy,,,2,2,2,4,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,8,Brian Robinson,12th October 2014,Flew GSO-ATL-SLC-PHX/ LAS-DTW-GSO on a paid First Class ticket - cost only 30% more than the coach ticket and well worth it. DL is working hard to be a serious airline and it's mostly paying off. All flights were on time and generally the service and food very good including a new beef enchilada (really!) lunch item that was excellent. The omelette breakfast out of LAS however- not so much. For me the biggest issue with DL is the age of the fleet. Both long legs were on vintage (25 years old plus) 757s with no modern amenities except pay for WIFI. These old ships showed their age throughout including (my pet peeve) dreadful bathrooms no entertainment whatsoever and old style overhead bins. The one flight with no first class section was aboard the dreaded CRJ200 for a 90 minute flight.. DL generously assigned seat 14A with a GE engine seemingly in the next seat. When will the airlines fulfil their promise of dumping these dogs altogether rather than just moving them from one fleet to another? Overall though satisfaction delivered.,,,First Class,,,3,5,4,1,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,Gilbert Schwartz,12th October 2014,JFK-FCO return Business class on Sept. 25 - Oct. 5. on A330 - this is the best business class seat by far. Seats newly configured 1-2-1 with easy aisle access. Seat controls entertainment system electronics all user friendly. Lots of entertainment options viewed on a 16-inch flat panel screen. Exceptional service and excellent meal choices.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,5,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,Peter Pomeranze,8th October 2014,Honolulu to LA. Lucked out with an internationally equipped aircraft for this normally cramped flight. Great lie flat seat wonderful crew decent meal and excellent entertainment. The B767 business elite made the trip a pleasure but why does the dessert come on the tray when there is plenty of time to do a separate service? This is a pet peeve of mine makes the service seem pedestrian.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,3,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,7,C Frauches,8th October 2014,Have just arrived in Rio de Janeiro from Miami with a change of planes in Atlanta. From Miami to Atlanta pilot did not even announce the flight duration. From Atlanta to Rio service was certainly not bad by U.S. standards. IFE was good-managed to watch a new release in my personal screen-while alcoholic beverages were also complementary throughout the flight. Arrived on-time in Rio de Janeiro only to find-out that my luggage did not make the tight connection in Atlanta. All in all certainly an acceptable trip and would do it again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,,A Ryerson,8th October 2014,"Just added Delta to the airlines that I will never fly again. American was the only one with that recognition previously. Booked flight for two from Des Moines to San Francisco and return. Outgoing flight was as planned and no problems. Noticed when I checked in the day before flight that return connection from Minneapolis to DSM had gone from 1 hour to 3+ hour layover. Just tried to change departure time from SFO to Minneapolis so flight would make more sense (1 hour layover). Said they would be happy to for $235! I make sane rationale reservations with ""standard"" layovers and airline changes (or cancels) a flight doesn't inform me and after I learn about it and try to make sense of the booking again they are happy to change for additional $$$. There is something very wrong with this picture. In the future they have 2 empty seats from my wife and me.",,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,9,James Steward,5th October 2014,Flew SYD-LAX-MNL. All flights were on time aircraft were clean staff very friendly food satisfactory lavatories well maintained and inflight entertainment stable with a great selection of choices. Safety was adhered to throughout flights. Check-in was smooth. However LAX could have more staff support during the check-in process. Baggage arrived promptly after each flight. Will fly Delta again.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,Alex Taberner,5th October 2014,JFK-LAX on a 757-200 Transcon. Flight pushed back 5 mins ahead of schedule and arrived 30 mins early. The aircraft was recently refitted and the new cabin is spectacular. Felt clean modern fresh airy bright and very comfortable. The IFE was superb. Screens were huge choice was endless and picture quality great (not the standard screens you see on most aircraft). Staff were attentive and happy - came around with the drinks/snacks cart twice and I lost count how many times they came around offering water. Tea/coffee and snacks are complimentary sandwiches etc available for purchase. For a long coast to coast flight Delta far exceeded my expectations.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,Valerie Morzillo,1st October 2014,Flights 476 and 477. Flew first Class to Barcelona Spain on August 17 2014. Excellent service.,,,First Class,,,5,5,4,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,6,Derek Salter,1st October 2014,First class from PDX to LAX. On time good seat comfortable and plenty of space. Easy check in and boarding. Early arrival. Inflight food and beverages woeful. Very limited beverages and my choice of red wine not available. No food apart from a 1/2oz bag of crisps or peanuts. For a two-hour flight something more substantial should be available in First. And nothing else even available for purchase. Staff on board ok. Disappointing apart from the seat comfort and space. I had bought a discounted First class ticket otherwise not worth it. And no access to Delta lounge for First pax unless paid for ($50) or a regular card holder for this service.,,,First Class,,,5,3,1,,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,1,Jared Costley,22nd September 2014,I have had several horrible experiences with Delta. One time on my way back from a vacation from Hawaii Delta changed the connecting flight from the Las Vegas Airport to an earlier time. I was not informed until I arrived in Las Vegas only to find out that our connecting flight had already departed. The Delta Customer Service clerk was extremely unhelpful and ended up booking us on a flight that left 5 hours later. I sat in the Las Vegas airport with two small children for several hours. Today I was supposed to fly out to New York at 11.00 am for an important business trip. As I was leaving for the airport I got a call from Delta stating that the flight was delayed until 12.15 pm. Since that phone call the flight has been further delayed three-times. Delta is the worst airline I have ever flown on hands-down with extremely poor customer service.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,3,2,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,1,Barbara Madureira,19th September 2014,First time flying Delta was a terrible experience and I will never fly Delta again. Check in was really bad. My seat did not recline and my flight was LA to Sydney it means 15 hours flying in the same position. The seat was near the back of the plane where the flight attendants stay during the flight. They wouldn't close the curtains so it was always with lights on and I could hear them talking and laughing for 15 hours. It was my worst nightmare and I do not recommend Delta to anyone. There was other seats available but they wouldn't give us other seats.,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,3,3,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,10,P Hendrix,19th September 2014,Sep 1 from TYS-DTW-AMS-GVA return on Sep 15 from GVA-AMS-ATL-TYS. Just returned from traveling and used Delta and KLM. My opinion is that Delta has improved its flight services and food on transcontinental flights. Flights were on time customer service was helpful flight attendants were pleasant. The cabin service was much more adequate than in past flights. We did purchase economy comfort seats on the outgoing flight and the extra inches were appreciated. I was very pleased and will continue to use Delta.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,D Schmeisser,19th September 2014,IMT-DEN-SAN-IMT. All flights were on time or early. Ground and flight attendants courteous and efficient provided timely and useful info. The seats and entertainment on the new B737 are quite good for economy. Beef sandwich for purchase was at best OK. Beverages passed a few times on a 3 hr SAN-MSP flight. In my opinion Delta provides a good consistent product these days.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,A Shah,19th September 2014,Extremely poor service. A family of five flew to Orlando via Detroit. After a lot of hassle on my part I was able to organise the special meals for us on our flight to Detroit. It was expected that the airline would have done so the same for the return flight but this did not happen with the result we were denied this request.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,1,3,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,10,Brian E Smith,17th September 2014,NRT-HNL-NRT in business class both ways. The flight was smooth on time had decent food lie-flat seats and a very accommodating HNL-based crew of FA. No complaints whatsoever. It always amazes me at the negative comments on this review site considering my consistently good experiences with Delta. They're not the best airline in the world but they seem to try their best.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,4,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,J Krinsky,17th September 2014,Delta 1487 on 09-04-14 from ATL to JFK. The gate agent addressed my wife and I by name as we boarded. All passengers were greeted by the F/A as they boarded. Flight left a few minutes late but arrived early. The meal consisted of a cold shrimp/chicken platter or a turkey/chicken sandwich which was very good. Service was good. My only complaint is the seating. The seat is more comfortable than Economy Comfort but Delta should add an inch of pitch in the first class cabin. I did not rate the inflight entertainment as there was none available due to the short flight. Delta 2043 first class on 09-11-14 JFK to ATL. Flight left about 30 minutes late due to mechanical problems. The captain gave detailed and many updates concerning takeoff times which was appreciated. The plane was an MD 88. Again no inflight entertainment due to the short flight. Food and beverages included snacks from a basket.,,,First Class,,,4,5,5,,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,7,A Skidmore,17th September 2014,Manchester - Atlanta - Quito - August 2014. Flew Delta for the first time in about a decade and was very impressed. Transatlantic flew an old but recently refurbished 767-2 which was clean and comfortable. Was fortunate to get an exit row seat meaning I had lots of leg room and being 6'3 this was a blessing! Seats were a little hard but no more so than other airlines. Entertainment system was very good lots of options and food and drinks were served regularly. Cabin crew were very friendly and always happy to help. Flight departed on time and arrived early in ATL. ATL-QUI - very old 757-2 and desperately needed refurbing. Seats were worn out no entertainment overhead TVs existed but not used and cabin crew were less friendly. Drinks only served once on a 5 hour flight and food was very poor in comparison to the other flight. Standard American airline for me very good transatlantic but domestic/South America used tired fleet and much less effort made. Will certainly use again if I need to fly transatlantic as was an excellent experience but still much to improve on the other side of the pond.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,4,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,,C Tellefsen,14th September 2014,I keep making the mistake of choosing Delta. I flew to Spain recently and now within the us and each time I am unable to be seated with my husband regardless of how in advance I book my tickets. When I just called to inquire about a seat assignment the representative was beyond rude and said if I could not afford the upgrade then I can wait till I get to the gate like always. I have no problem paying for an upgrade but it seems to me they purposely do that so you pay the money or pay by sitting alone! Rude and not accommodating at all.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,no
Delta Air Lines,,B Hagler,14th September 2014,I flew from Omaha to Minneapolis. Minneapolis to Paris. Paris to Yaounde Cameroon. Returning flight from Yaounde was cancelled. Left the following morning. Flew to Central African Republic then to Chad. From Chad to Paris. Once a 6 hour flight turned into almost 13 hours. One meal provided.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,3,4,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,2,Nowara Michael,14th September 2014,Flying on 8/25 from EWR to AMS and return on 9/5 ex AMS to EWR in Economy Comfort. Save your money not worth it. Food was horrible. Flight attendance not very polite. Service was non-existent. I asked for an after dinner drink and was told only coffee Tea or water was available. This is not what Delta advertises on Economy Comfort. Have flown many times on Lufthansa to Germany and the service is 100% better. I will stay away from Delta in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,1,3,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,10,Davona Sanders,9th September 2014,July 28 - August 2 2014. DTW to Las Vegas. My husband and I flew Delta this past July (2014) to Las Vegas. I think the staff did a wonderful job. They always offered snacks and drinks. We will definitely fly Delta again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,B Denessen,9th September 2014,Round trip Detroit to Ft Lauderdale 8/28-9/1. Once again Delta has maintenance issues. We missed our connection lose our first class seats and get home 10 hours late. By the way do not purchase first class tickets. Delta apparently can choose to honor them or not. What a waste of money. I chose to purchase rather than upgrade and still lost my seats. The trip down here in first class offered potato chips for lunch and one drink because our flight attendant spent his time talking to another flight attendant that must have been riding for free because she didn't come out of the galley the entire flight. I guess I should just be happy they got us to our destination. Red coats are useless and maintenance is worst as our plane wasn't the only flight delayed that day due to maintenance.,,,First Class,,,3,3,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,10,Davona Sanders,9th September 2014,July 28 - August 2 2014. DTW to Las Vegas. My husband and I flew Delta this past July (2014) to Las Vegas. I think the staff did a wonderful job. They always offered snacks and drinks. We will definitely fly Delta again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,A Aloysius,9th September 2014,SEA-LHR and AMS-SEA I had an excellent experience on these international flights with Delta. The seats were relatively spacious and comfortable and the IFE was really impressive. The food was edible and there were frequent drink services. I had a far better experience than I did with Air Canada on similar routes. I will definitely be flying with Delta on future trips to Europe.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,Joe Mitzel,6th September 2014,Flew MSP-LAX-OGG (Maui) RT and was pleased with Delta in both directions. The flights are long so not terribly comfortable but a very nice attendant suggested that I move to Economy Plus seating for the extra legroom on the outbound to Maui. The food options were tasty and fairly-priced. I appreciated that the crew wore Hawaiian- inspired outfits to put us in a festive mood. Hawaii is such an exceptional destination it deserves the extra touches! Delta is my choice for flights lately because they work hard to deserve my business.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,Shi Haowei,6th September 2014,I flew IND-DTW-JFK to connect to an Air China flight to Beijing there and PVG-DTW-IND on the way back. I was originally suppose to fly IND-JFK to connect to Air China but the flight was delayed to after 9am and I would miss the Air China flight by then. So the agent booked me through Detroit. A320 service to Detroit no food because it was only 30 minutes CRJ900 service to JFK had soda and peanuts. On the way back I was supposed to fly Air China PVG-PEK-JFK and Delta to IND. Air China got delayed and they rebooked me on PVG-DTW-IND Boeing 777 to DTW good food had many choices. No food for the DTW-IND flight as usual. Nice flight attendants good seating good entertainment funny safety video.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,2,H Sucic,6th September 2014,Flew JFK-MCO on Aug 28 in Economy Comfort. Aircraft ok massive delay on taxi way due to congestion. Cabin crew had no control over passengers - children were running up and down aisle yelling banging on seats including when seat belt sign was on. Crew didn't bat an eyelid even when others were out of their seats on final approach with belt light illuminated. We then flew MCO-LAX on Sep 1. Old tired aircraft with video screens fixed to ceiling. Crew inserting VHS tapes for IFE. Cabin smelt dirty carpet dirty everything. Time to retire the 757 fleet. Economy comfort seats hard and uncomfortable.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,2,,,,no
Delta Air Lines,3,A Bastien,6th September 2014,Mid August. YYZ-MSP-SMF (Toronto - Minneapolis - Sacramento). Return trip. The economy comfort seats from MSP to SMF were adequate decent legroom acceptable recline. Other than legroom they were not much different from the ones on Endeavor Air / Delta Connection from YYZ to MSP. The plastic armrests from MSP-SMF were very uncomfortable. These seats are similar to the ones on Delta international flights. I will no longer fly Delta on internationally and will try another carrier such as KLM on my next trip to Europe. One star for food and entertainment (I didn't buy food no entertainment offered). The flight attendants were competent and courteous.,,,Premium Economy,,,2,5,1,1,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,10,E Ciancanelli,6th September 2014,My wife and I recently flew first class on Delta Airlines from Seattle to San Diego on flight 5789. The aircraft was a Jet Embraer 175 a plane that I think is very practical comfortable and sensible for a domestic flight. Also there are no middle seats anywhere on this plane. The crew were very friendly and attentive to our needs. The food was excellent and nicely presented and served by our attentive stewardess. We felt this was the best flight we have taken in a very long time and was reminiscent of air travel from the old days. I have been a frequent air traveler for 55 years so I remember the good old days of travel. I contrast this flight with another first class flight on United Airlines where the service and food were horrible and the plane was filthy with a bathroom that was worse than any gas station I ever saw.,,,First Class,,,5,5,5,1,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,3,A Bastien,6th September 2014,Early August flight from SMF - MSP - YYZ (Sacramento - Minneapolis - Toronto). I flew economy comfort on an early flight from SMF to MSP The MSP to YYZ flight was on Endeavor Air / Delta Connection. The economy comfort seats had adequate legroom but almost no recline making it impossible for me to nap (the seat backs had a tilt-your- head-forward built-in headrest). The seats on Endeavour had minimal legroom but more recline and I was able to nap during the two-hour flight to Toronto. The plastic armrests on the SMF-MSP flight were extremely uncomfortable. Economy comfort wasn't worth the money. One star for food and entertainment (I didn't buy food for purchase no entertainment on either flight). My wife has Delta Platinum FF status. Next month we fly to Michigan Amsterdam France and Israel. I'll let her exchange FF miles for my tickets as long as we avoid Delta and fly internationally on a code share airline such as KLM. The FAs on both flights were competent courteous and seemed to care about their passengers. I wish Delta management had the same attitude.,,,Premium Economy,,,1,5,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,7,Domican Anne,28th August 2014,Flew Dublin - JFK return in business elite. Didn't really get that priority feel on check in as you do with most other airlines. Lounge in Dublin ok lounge in JFK terminal 2 is awful. Food is fine and there was plenty of offerings cabin crew very nice seats very comfortable but I think Virgin Etihad and Qatar Airways business class is far better with a classier feel to it. On saying that I would fly with them again.,,,Business Class,,,4,4,3,3,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,3,D Stewart,26th August 2014,My husband and I have taken a few trips a year with our kids (now 4 and 3) since they were babies and never had such a terrible experience. Getting to our destination was alright - we booked an overnight flight so that the kids would sleep and ended up with 2 extra seats next to us. Staff were all very polite and helpful. However before our return we were informed by e-mail that our 2 flights with a connection of just over an hour had been cancelled and we had been re-booked on 4 flights - yes 3 layovers to get us from one major airport in the US to another in Canada. My husband spent over an hour on the phone getting this changed and it took a great deal of insisting that 4 flights would not work especially with young kids. Our travel dates were flexible as was the departure airport from Florida but this didn't make a difference. We were finally re-booked on 2 flights with an almost 6 hour layover. We were told that having a layover longer than 5 hours would result in additional fees which we of course refused to pay and Delta reluctantly agreed. On the day of the flight we arrived at our gate to find out that our first flight had been delayed almost an hour and our second flight had been delayed 3 hours. (which now resulted in an 8 hour layover!). The airport staff was extremely accommodating and offered to re book us on a flight early the next morning with a 2 hour layover and cover our hotel expenses for the night. We appreciated the offer but decided to decline because we were already at our departure gate and didn't want to repeat the check in and security process the following day. Sometime during our 8 hour layover we looked at our boarding passes and noticed that none of us were sitting together on our second flight. After putting up with an excessive amount of delays and attitude from Delta over the phone and by e-mail I would have gladly left my then 2 and 4 year olds alone for Delta staff to entertain during the flight but after some insisting on my part we were all seated together.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,4,2,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,,S Ahmed,26th August 2014,"Munich - Atlanta - Kalamazoo and returning from Chicago - Atlanta - Munich. My flight to the US was nothing better than the usual - in fact simply average no comment to make. However the adventure begins on my returning flight from Chicago on 30th December. Upon checking in my luggage in Chicago I find out that my flight to Atlanta had been cancelled - apparently for weather reasons. I quickly had customer service representatives put me on an alternative route: Chicago - New York - Prague - Munich. However upon embarking the flight to New York we had technical difficulties and could not take off on time. When we did I had already missed my connection. Knowing about this situation I asked the flight attendant to assist just to be told ""hold on we'll look into it"" or ""you simply ask the ground staff in New York they'll sort you out"". Upon arriving in JFK instead of making my way to the gate I straight went to Delta Customer Services. Getting there it was like being at a fish market - people arguing kids crying and the Delta Customer Service staff simply could not be bothered. When it was my turn I was not greeted I was not asked how I was doing and nor was given the generic apology for delays experienced. After a long discussion I was put on a flight from New York - Frankfurt - Munich. After a couple of hours of transit with no amenities or vouchers provided I got on the flight for Frankfurt - I was put right at the back despite various empty seats. I reached Frankfurt to find out - my ticket was never issued for Munich! However being German speaking and after being handed to competent Fraport staff and discussing the issue with them in detail - the situation was dealt with in an excellent manner and I was on my next flight to Munich. Once I touched down in Munich you can now imagine what is going to come or in fact not going to come - my luggage! Will never travel with them again.",,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,8,K Gundeep,26th August 2014,Flew CDG-MSP-YYZ. First aircraft was an A330-200 which was somewhat spacious. IFE was excellent but the headphones were not that great. Seats were nice and the blanket and pillow were good. The meals were above averages and were filling. A lot of drink services too. Connection was a breeze as well. The flight after that was a CRJ-900 so it was more cramped and without IFE but the aircraft was new and spotless. Seats and service was OK for a regional flight. Wifi on board but you have to pay. All in all the two flights were pleasant and really surprised me.,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,5,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,7,Howell Eric,20th August 2014,MCO-LHR via Atlanta. The internal flight up to Atlanta was surprisingly spacious seating in economy for this short flight. The transatlantic flight from Atlanta to London was on a B767 with a decent seat with good leg room. The IFE offers a good choice to occupy the time and the meal was ok and standard for economy. Delta is a no nonsense airline that does the job you pay for.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,Marla Kostis,20th August 2014,Flew MEX-DTW recently on Delta on a nice and fairly clean A319. Economy class seats had decent legroom - inflight wifi was a huge plus but no other IFE was on offer even in business class. Ham and cheese sandwich was served as a snack which surprised me as I expected no food in economy class. Flight arrived and departed on time. Staff were attentive and polite.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,2,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,6,C Lyttle,18th August 2014,A few months ago I was flying home from Chicago via Minneapolis. I don't really care to connect but Delta had the lowest fares and I was okay with that. The flight to Minneapolis from Chicago was delayed due to a plane issue. The staff on the ground were excellent at handling the issue and on the plane they were helpful as well. Unfortunately this was not the case with the rest of the staff. Upon arrival to Minneapolis I had to run to my gate to make my flight. As I got there I had to argue with the gate attendant about getting my seat. Note I'm a 17 year old who can't book a hotel has nowhere to stay and needs to be on that flight the last one out that night. Thankfully the man gave me his seat and I made it home. Staff on the MSP-MCO leg were very rude. I was very unimpressed. I love Delta but it put a sour taste in my mouth.,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,4,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,,J Peng,18th August 2014,We are a family of 6 going on vacation from San Jose California to Las Vegas with a connecting flight in Los Angeles. We missed our flight from San Jose to LA and therefore missed our connecting flight from LA to Vegas and therefore wasted a whole day (1/3 of our trip) in LAX. We missed our flight in San Jose because we did not arrive at the gate until the last 3 min of departing time. However two of our family members arrived at the gate early because they used the handicapped express lane at security point. The family members that arrived early told the gate agent that there are more people coming please wait. The agent was rude did not even page for our names and refuse to wait. By the time the rest of the family got to the gate the plane has already taken off 2min earlier which is 5 min earlier than departing time! This kind of customer service is unacceptable!,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,8,Brian Smith,18th August 2014,NRT-ATL in business elite. The aircraft is an old 747 but renovated a few years back with the lie flat seats and if you're in the upper deck very nice indeed. It's quiet two toilets for less than 20 passengers and two flight attendants. The entertainment selection is excellent. My vegetarian meal was OK nothing special but not bad. It was a smooth and comfortable flight. The only complaint I have is about the service. The FA's on US carriers are very familiar and have a jokey attitude that I think most Americans quite enjoy. I have lived overseas for over 20 years and do not like that. I prefer kind polite service without the constant sarcasm and humor.,,,Business Class,,,4,3,4,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,5,Barry Woolnough,18th August 2014,Traveled from SYD-LAX return in Economy Comfort on Boeing 777-200. Service was ok but the seats are very hard and uncomfortable. Had a look at the Business class seats when disembarking and they felt just as hard. Really needs refurbishing.,,,Premium Economy,,,1,4,4,4,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,,Yelmini Marcelo,13th August 2014,I was on Delta Flight DL101 from Atlanta to Buenos Aires. The flight took of with some delay and after 2 hours in the air we returned again to Atlanta due to a problem with the plane. The problem came afterwards. We arrived at 4 am our new departure was delayed. Nobody from Delta provided a clear view of what the plan was. 12 hours after our original departure time we were still at the airport and nobody from Delta would give an answer. Last time on a Delta Flight for me.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,3,4,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,2,M Brokaw,13th August 2014,Was scheduled afternoon of 8/11/14 to fly from Lansing MI to Minneapolis then on to DFW. About 2.5 hours before flight received automated call that flight from Lansing had been cancelled and that they would call back with a rebooking (no explanation given as to why the flight was cancelled). Automated call back had put me on a flight out the next day at around 1.30 in the afternoon getting me to Dallas about 5.30pm on 12th. I called back and managed to get rebooked on a flight on the 12th leaving Lansing to Detriot at 6am then on to DFW getting in around 9.20am the next day (an effort to try to salvage most of the work day on the 12th). Arrived to Lansing airport about 4.30am on the 12th only to be told that the 6am flight was also cancelled (again gate agent had no explanation of why the flight was cancelled). Their only option was to put me on the same afternoon flight the automated service had booked me on the previous day. My 80-something year old parents ended up driving me to Detroit to make the 7.28am connection. Complained to Delta and was given a refund of about $29 (which I haven't seen yet). This didn't even cover the cost of the fuel my parents used to get from Lansing to Detroit and back).,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,4,,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,8,Howell Eric,13th August 2014,Economy LHR-MCO via BOS. First time in 4 years with Delta and I have to say I was impressed. The seat on the 767 out of LHR was fine (and I am a big chap) with good leg room. Flight attendants were professional if not a little unsmiling. Food service was good and drinks complimentary. The IFE was good with a good selection. The internal flight down to MCO was delayed an hour due to bad weather but we made up some time during the flight. For me Delta is a no nonsense service that ticks boxes without the wow factor.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,4,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,1,G Larkins,11th August 2014,Delta did not notify me of flight cancellation of a direct flight from PHX to JFK airport that was to leave at 8.30 which had been changed previously from 9.30 until we had arrived at the terminal. Put us on a flight to Atlanta Airport transferred to another flight to JFK. After boarding waited for about an hour to find out they could not take off due to weather. We were then put on standby at another Atlanta terminal. We had advised the counter person that we had a doctor's appointment in NY the next morning and needed to get there. In watching the monitor for open seats I noticed they were asking for people that wanted to upgrade to 1st class. We had paid for 1st class round-trip tickets and were not called to fill in those seats. Because I complained about the service we were able to take those seats. We arrived At JFK at about 1.30 am the next day. Because of Delta we paid for a $200 hotel room that we did not use. When leaving JFK on our return trip on Delta we sat on the plane for 1.5 hours for a cap from a baggage handler to be removed from engine that had been sucked into it we finally took off. We should have been treated more courteously and not like a herd of cattle especially as a 1st class ticket holder. We paid for more!,,,First Class,,,3,2,2,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,3,V Pardeshi,11th August 2014,"I flew from Mumbai to Detroit with a layover at Amsterdam with the total flight duration of 18.5 hours. The delta flight from Mumbai left about 1.5 hours late and the flight from Amsterdam to Detroit left 15 mins earlier leaving us stranded at Amsterdam. I was then rebooked to fly from Amsterdam to Chicago and Chicago to Detroit all the direct Detroit flights being overbooked. I had no choice but to take the flight to Detroit the flight from Chicago to Detroit was being taken care of by ""United Airlines"".",,,Economy Class,,,2,1,3,3,,3,no

Delta Air Lines,1,David Pumputis,11th August 2014,Took a flight from Phoenix AZ to Rochester NY with a plane change in Minneapolis MN. I arrived at Minneapolis 40 minutes between flights so plenty of time then we were told that there will be a delay because of mechanical issues and had to wait for a new plane. While we were waiting at the next gate we found out that plane was also delayed for mechanical issues. The replacement plane finally arrived 2 hours later we boarded and were just about to back out of the gate when the captain announced that we will be delayed for mechanical issues. I arrived 2.5 hours later from my scheduled arrival time. The return trip wasn't any better the plane arrived 2 hours late. I arrived in Atlanta as my connecting flight was taking off. That was the last flight out of Atlanta until the next morning. I got my ticket no problem but when I asked about a hotel. They would only give me a coupon for a reduced rate. I felt I shouldn't have to pay for something g that wasn't my fault. So I got to spend 12+ hours in the terminal. Never flying Delta again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,8,M Seymour,6th August 2014,Flew late July on Delta round trip from Minneapolis to Beijing and back with two layovers in Seattle (SEA to MSP was on Alaska Airlines code share not included in ratings). Booked through travel agency. Overall an enjoyable and satisfactory trip. Only item of note is that a travel companion lost her passport on the MSP to SEA flight and couldn't board the plane to Beijing in Seattle help staff at SEA were very helpful and accommodating they got her passport back and put her on the next flight to Beijing.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,3,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,3,A Snow,6th August 2014,"I was almost convinced to switch to Delta from US Airways and United where I have status. For 3 of 4 legs of travel the flight attendants and gate agents were friendly and professional and the service was good. This was my second flight on Delta and I was unfamiliar with their seating protocol. On August 8 Flight 5151 from LGA to CLT I asked a flight attendant if the flight was full and if I could move my seat. She did not refuse. Another flight attendant arrived and the two attendants had a less than professional conversation. She then walked up to me with a flight manage at and asked if I was passenger (name) and then said I could not sit in this seat because these seats were Premium. It was a false show. The first attendant could have asked if I'd like to upgrade to Premium or provided an honest response simply saying ""Unfortunately no."" Honesty integrity and professionalism is important.",,,Economy Class,,,3,1,3,,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,,S Shah,2nd August 2014,Last year I had a flight from Dubai to Atlanta. The flight was supposed to take off at 9.30pm from Dubai. We were told that the flight was delayed 3 hours. At 12.30am they said it was still delayed by 4 more hours. At 4.30 they got everyone onboard and the flight didn't take of until 9am. Then they announced that due to some technical faults the flight was cancelled. We were asked to sit in the Airport Lounge for whole day. After 15 hours the flight took off. Overall the flight was delayed by approx 27 hours. They did not want to provide hotel accommodation the staff were very rude. No one was interested in responding to our questions.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,2,2,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,8,S Koenig,2nd August 2014,GRU-ATL-MDW and SEA-DTW-GRU business class. Very comfortable truly lie-flat seats in 767s for the international legs (maybe not quite as nice as the A330s of US Airways in biz class). My wife had asked for boarding assistance due to an arm injury and she said whenever she made any move on the GRU-ATL leg an attendant was at her side almost immediately. No Delta club at GRU so had to use the somewhat smaller and more basic Gol Airlines club. First class for the ATL-MDW and SEA-DTW legs was your basic domestic first class. Nothing spectacular but fine. Decent selection of movies at least in the 767s.,,,Business Class,,,4,5,4,3,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,Saketh Rahm,31st July 2014,Flew DEN-JFK then CDG-MSP-DEN in Business. Was pleasantly surprised as I had not travelled DL in about 10 years. Domestic segments decent with excellent service and meals. Crew chatty and actually acted like they wanted to there. CDG-MSP with flat seats on A330. Crew were okay but still miss the class of European carriers and kindness of EK/SQ. No smiles and rather perfunctory service. Food better than AF and seat much better; Entertainment was excellent with big screen and got about 3 hours of good sleep. Only negative was appalling ground staff at JFK- rude surly and could care less. Will avoid JFK as best as I can.,,,Business Class,,,5,3,4,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,1,R Kelly,29th July 2014,"One thing I find really ironic with Delta Airlines is at the beginning of the safety video they state that ""your comfort and needs are our first priority"" when it's is absolutely not the case it seems like it's the profit Delta can make. I'm not normally one to complain however after flying with Delta 3 times something needed to be said. From LA to NY return and from NY to Honolulu my family were unable to have seating together due to not booking a 'particular way' despite the fact we booked months in advance! It seems this manner of booking was only available to people who booked in USA as no information on booking allocated seats was known to us (Australian origin). Moreover we weren't the only people who encountered this issue. Another passenger was unable to be seated with their 4 and 8 year old children due to their ridiculous seating policy. Do it the right way Delta first checked in first choice. Service was bad. Rude at check in. Rude and unhelpful at the gate and even on flight they held their tradition by attendants having domestic quarrels on the plane around passengers. Food is terrible all flights are over 5 hours and only offered 2 biscuits or a small bag of pretzels unless you pay. Some entertainment also unavailable; however what was available were decent movies. Surprisingly Delta can do something right. Save your time money and hunger for an airline who cares about their passengers needs. This service isn't even worth the $10 you would pay to watch the entertainment available.",,,Economy Class,,,3,2,1,4,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,1,I Hiberman,29th July 2014,ATL to UIO on DL 673. Flight was on an ageing 757. Paid extra for comfort class row 19. Narrow seat due to tray in arm rest. Try was broken and FA could care less. Offered no help. Food of poor quality/taste. Entertainment system from last century. Crew member makes PA announcement for anyone needing the lav to go before they pull the carts. 10 people queue up in front of my seat and wait. Crew fighting with each other over cabin responsibilities. Extended delay in FA picking up dirty trays which sat for almost one solid hour. Bad flight in every regard!,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,2,2,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,2,C Henshaw,29th July 2014,JFK-YUL on Delta Connection embraer regional jet. Terminal 2 at JFK must be the worst place in the world to change planes. After entering the path to the aircraft it became worse as the metal tunnel seemed to be falling to bits loose floor and walls looked like they had been run over several times. Inflight service was dire and not at mainline airline standard - inflight entertainment consists of the safety briefing and looking out the window. Inflight snack service consists of biting your own fingernails. Although flight was early this level of service is what I expect from cheap airlines like Ryanair not those charging a premium price. Look for alternatives.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,8,T Jenkins,27th July 2014,My latest flight on Delta was PHL-MSP-AMS-ARN-AMS-JFK-PHL. Why such a circuitous route to Stockholm? Delta's service: I seem to be the lucky person who gets a great flight crew (even when in Coach) good food and on time departures. The upgrade of the business cabin to business elite with lie flat beds was a great way to fully relax and get quality sleep. Even though I am now based in USAIR/American country I still fly Delta - and know a lot of great people in all of their hubs. Only drawback is their very restrictive FF program. But day to day I would rather have a good flight experience over using my miles to upgrade.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,4,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,2,J Rasley,22nd July 2014,Flight DL0056 Detroit to Heathrow: Passenger console did not work neither reading light nor audio/visual entertainment.

Delta Air Lines,1,Claudio Conca,17th July 2014,My experience with Delta was extremely frustrating. I bought 3 tickets from Milan to Denver with stop in Atlanta. One month before departure Delta changed the itinerary in Milan-JFK-Minneapolis-Denver which was exactly what I was not looking for (2 stops rather than 1). Too late to change tickets because of high prices. From NY we took off more than 2 hours late most time spent inside a super hot aircraft on a taxiway and consequently we were not able to get the flight from Minneapolis to Denver. Rescheduled for the next day we were forced to spend the night in the airport because the customer service horrible was not able to find a room in Minneapolis. Next day we took off late again.,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,3,3,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,10,Macdonald Jon,15th July 2014,Flew from Amsterdam to Boston DL267 Economy Comfort service was excellent FA's chatted and were very kind. I have noted that past reviews of Delta are not very good but that seems to be inter-American and not Delta's international flights. The Comfort seats have plenty of leg-room and are very good for a 7 hour flight and as they are just behind Business Class you de-board very quickly ! Flight back DL266 was just as good so I will be telling everyone to fly Delta.,,,Premium Economy,,,5,5,4,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,W Milner,12th July 2014,Flew from Atlanta to Las Vegas return for business convention. Smooth on time flight both ways excellent service and professional staff. On the flight back we sat on the tarmac for an extra 10 minutes or so. The pilot then proceeded to the runway. On the way he explained that he requested an alternate route out of Las Vegas since he wanted to avoid storm clouds and turbulent weather. I'm a nervous flyer and I was very impressed that Delta will actually do this. I'm sure it affected there on time statistics and probably cost Delta more in fuel expenses to take an alternate route. I will fly Delta from now on.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,5,R Moyer,10th July 2014,No more pre-boarding for passengers with children really? On a recent flight my family was instructed that Delta no longer allows passengers with small children to pre-board because there is now a pre-board fee that passengers are paying and 'got upset' that others were allowed to do so for free. This is yet another example of how Delta airlines are cutting service and delaying the overall boarding process. As a business owner and traveler I understand the desire to make money but this is going too far! Going forward I will research flights and airlines that are willing to accommodate my traveling family.

Delta Air Lines,10,John Wright,10th July 2014,Business Elite MSP-SEA-PEK-SEA-MSP. All Sectors were excellent. International Service was fine. Food was good. All Flights were on time and had a chance to use the new immigration Kiosk's. It was a little faster. Not sure why but got a hand written note from the purser thanking me for my business. I see a definite improvement with Delta. I hope it continues.,,,Business Class,,,4,5,4,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,E Weingrad,8th July 2014,I've flown Delta about 15-20 times. 90% of those trips have been work trips where I've not been given the option of flight provider. My current trip to Alaska from PHL leaves me without either of my bags because the Delta connecting flight out of MSP was 45 minutes delayed. Why was it delayed? Because they needed to kick 8 people off due to weight. This makes me wonder if they knew where they were flying before we got on. How can this oversight occur? Either way when I arrived in Anchorage to catch the connecting flight I had to run across the airport to make my flight with no time to spare. My bags didn't make it. Well now it's the next day and they can't confirm when my bags will arrive.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,1,3,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,Kashy Daniel,8th July 2014,My flight was delayed not for any weather or mechanical issue but because the captain of our plane decide not to show up to fly us. It has been almost double the flight time itself waiting in the terminal. This is completely unacceptable and I am disappointed with Delta who have always been a dependable airline. The remainder of staff handled it very well but I lost a lot of faith in Delta Airlines today.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,10,D Sun,8th July 2014,Flew DL #231 from Amsterdam to Boston on July 6 and I have to say that it was a great flight. On time departure early arrival. Very tasty meal (Thai chicken) perfectly adequate amount of food. Nice snacks first an ice cream then a sandwich. I really appreciate the large bottle of water everyone gets after the meal service. Inflight service was very efficient though I think the flight attendants could have smiled a bit more. Seat size and pitch were comfortable and I'm not a small person. Inflight entertainment was outstanding - a huge choice of movies both new releases and older classics - that I really didn't want the flight to end. Perhaps I'm just easily pleased but I found this Economy Class experience to be very good.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,4,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,1,George Thomas,8th July 2014,SFO-ATL on June 27 apparently an equipment change where I went from exit row aisle to row 45 next to the toilet. Not bad for a platinum 2 million miler! Finally found a gate manager who helped fix the problem but none of the front line employees can make a decision.,,,Premium Economy,,,1,1,1,3,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,1,P Miller,6th July 2014,Flight 718. This flight was booked almost one year ago. All 15 family members had seats together. Now we are leaving in a few days and guess what? Three members of our family have had their seats changed. When asked to give us back our original seats the representative supervisor stated they could not accommodate our request. They stated they have the right to change any seat. Well why can't they do the right thing and accommodate their customer and give us back our original seats and move the passengers to our new unwanted seats.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,8,N Ocampo,6th July 2014,Flew BOG-JFK-BOG. Check in at both ends flawless both flights left on time and arrived before schedule which I think is a great achievement. Service was good breakfast on the BOG-JFK very poor meal on the JFK-BOG was much better. Seats were uncomfortable but we had a great price for our tickets.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,4,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,,M Marquis,6th July 2014,Daughter took a flight from RDU-LAX. Flight attendant asked her to move her seat to accommodate a family who wanted to sit together then gave her a seat that didn't recline. It was unfortunate because a) by the time she realized she'd been duped the flight was taking off - and b) she just started flying and didn't know her rights as a passenger. My daughter did the airline a huge favor and got duped. It's a shame since my husband is an elite member who has been raving about Delta's supposed great service.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,Linda Boumarafi,6th July 2014,My experience started in Chicago on a flight bound for Phoenix via Minneapolis and a weather delay in Minneapolis. The experience quickly went from bad to abysmal after being delayed in Chicago. The flight crew could not help anyone with connections in Minneapolis. Although it was still afternoon the 800 number people were unable to come up with any alternate route. After nearly 4 hours of delay which included all the passengers deplaning we were loaded onto the plane after the gate next to us with a later flight going Minneapolis loaded. My flight to Phoenix which had also been delayed due to weather left 30 minutes before I got there and had our flight gone first as it should have I probably would have made my connection. But the Delta personal were unable or unwilling to deal with passenger issues like this. Instead I bunked down in the Minneapolis airport overnight. Meals were not provided even though all the restaurants in the airport were closed or closing when we arrived. The next day after 27.5 hours of travel I arrived in Phoenix but one of my bags did not. So while I understand that weather happens this airline has an appalling lack of kindness consideration or concern about getting people and their luggage to their destination.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,P McSherry,6th July 2014,"I bought a First Class ticket on Delta from Detroit to Newark. I'm on my third day of attempting to get there. There were endless delays and finally cancellation of the flights the first two days. I was on standby for two morning flights which took off. Delta was upgrading passengers on both flights and left me in the lurch. Passengers were getting information about further delays before the Delta agents were. Delta wasn't responsible for the cancellation of the flights but they didn't do anything to get me to my destination in a timely fashion. The ticket I got for today's flight is in coach which is OK with me as long as I get to my destination. Later I got what Delta called a ""complementary upgrade"" - and I'm thinking complementary nothing I paid for a first class ticket. The only thing Delta is excellent at is the phrase everyone at Delta seems to have been trained to use (hence insincere): We apologize for the inconvenience.",,,First Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,2,M Lusica,30th June 2014,Traveled many times with Delta and so far one airport layover stay due to delays which was fine at first until this time around. Had to stay overnight in Atlanta. Customer service is horrible. Flight times change a lot. One time I had to change an existing flight but the flight that I changed to got canceled. I do not understand why I couldn't get a reimbursement for the change fee when the flight that I wanted doesn't even exist anymore. Now that I know better I'd rather pay for a more reliable airline than stick with cheaper fares for essentially a game of chance. Will avoid this airline in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,3,3,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,3,Trevor Wilson,30th June 2014,Flew Delta first class from Atlanta to San Francisco quite possibly the worst flight crew ever more interested in talking to each other than helping passengers one flight crew tried to give my blazer to 2 separate passengers before it got to me unacceptable when you pay to fly first. Cramped seating did not help matters either. A very unpleasant flight.,,,First Class,,,2,1,2,2,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,1,Kimberley A Scheffers,30th June 2014,Delta is extremely frustrating to deal with! We took a family vacation to Alaska. There were 8 of us and we had two stops each way. I reserved seats when I booked the flights. When I checked in online for every flight for all 8 of us I found that all of the seats had been changed for every flight! We were on a family vacation and I picked seats for a reason. The answer I got every time I called was that they switch planes a lot and the seats don't match. I can't imagine that all of the planes were changed! I hope that I never have to fly Delta again! They need to take lessons from Alaska and Southwest!,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,5,K Hamilton,30th June 2014,Marked difference in quality and service between transatlantic and domestic flights travelled Dublin to PDX and back via ATL and both transatlantic legs progressed well with excellent service and no delays while both internal flights were delayed onboard service was spotty at best and boarding was sheer pandemonium. I have never appreciated Ryanair more than after my first experience trying to board a domestic flight in the US.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,2,5,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,9,P Pomeranze,25th June 2014,Short flight Shanghai to Narita. Very well done. 777 Business Elite has an odd layout can't see out window even in window seat without craning neck. Other than that comfortable nice breakfast and excellent professional crew. Bring that style to domestic flights and Delta will succeed.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,2,Jo Carryer,25th June 2014,Delta 2366 JFK to MSP. Delayed for broken plane - we were in line to take off when they decided a broken panel light warranted fixing. We had no gate to return to at JFK so we went to the maintenance lot and were bussed back to the terminal. Had to wait for a new plane (another hour). Re-boarding pandemonium. Most frustrating was waiting another hour on the tarmac before taxi-ing await from gate for catering. this was around 11.30am. We got nothing to eat drink except one bottle of water. Arrived MSP around 12.30am. Pretty awful. Stewardesses standing around on their cell phone. Skip Delta if you have the chance.,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,2,,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,4,George Bosse,25th June 2014,Flights in purchased domestic first class with changeover in Minneapolis. Lots of weather delays and was kept well informed and phone conversations with customer service were pleasant. The first three legs of the journey were nothing special. Notably the quality of the product purchased was only that of a larger seat. Inflight service was casual at best and I would not call it friendly. We were tolerated and it kind of felt like we were an inconvenience. The last flight however had a flight attendant who was service oriented and actually took care of the customer properly and a meal was served. To me this tells me that there is a quality issue at Delta. The inflight service product is not consistent.,,,First Class,,,4,2,2,1,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,6,Tercon Bojan,25th June 2014,The CRJ 700 service from Halifax to La Guardia in New York is a quick 90 min hop. The economy seats are cramped but they are on all the Canadair regional jets in economy class. I got my drink. I got my pretzels. And other than that the flight was completely uneventful. This is when you realise flying has become a complete commodity. Now how could we change that?,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,2,1,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,J Roberts,25th June 2014,"This flight was in ""Business Elite"" between Austin Texas and Buenos Aires Argentina with an intermediate stop in Atlanta Georgia. The outbound trip was in early February 2014 and the return was in mid February 2014. Measured against other US carriers international performance Delta was exceptional.

Other than one sort of ""rough around the edges"" male flight attendant on the return trip the entire experience was quite acceptable.",,,First Class,,,5,4,4,3,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,7,T Warunee,20th June 2014,Flew Mar 30 NRT to BKK. All flights were great. Flight was on-time and the in-flight entertainment was great. Apart from the meals - some Thai passengers cannot eat beef so the flight crews tried to ask other passengers who could eat beef and changed the meals around.

I was slated to take flight 3997 from LaGuardia to Pittsburgh (PIT) leaving at 6.59pm arriving in Pittsburgh at 8.35pm. Every time I fly Delta I end up getting stuck in whatever airport my layover is for 12+ hours due to cancellations or delays.

Delta Air Lines,,John Arrigo,17th June 2014,Delta Website froze 4 times trying to set up flight to three different locations. Had to call and set up over the phone only to find out at the curb our flights were changed with no coumarin to us. My pregnant wife and I sat for over an hour (on the curb) for them to correct the error. We flew to our next location to find the same issue with boarding. We sat outside the line for a half hour while they tried to correct before the plane flew off. I spoke to Delta and they said because of the economy they are having issues. This does not explain why they couldn't send us an e-mail showing our flights changed with new boarding passes. The worst flying experience ever. They could care less about you even if you need special attention. Check baggage fees - Delta packs the plane and charges outrageous prices for additional bags.,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,4,4,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,9,P Pomeranze,16th June 2014,Narita - Bangkok June 13 Business Elite 747. Slight delay due to hold for other delayed inbound flights but all in all an excellent flight. Chief Purser was an experienced friendly (old school) gentleman who worked hard to insure good service. Seat was a comfortable lie flat pod offering more privacy than the first class American 777 I had just connected from. Decent food with even a light second offering before landing. Excellent entertainment options offered. I would certainly do this again.,,,Business Class,,,5,4,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,R Jednak,16th June 2014,"I just returned from a round-trip First/Business Elite FLL-ATL-MUC-ATL-FLL trip. I really must say that all the flights were great. Every flight was on-time the flight crews were exceptionally good the in-flight entertainment was good but could be improved the meals were good and tasty. I only wish Delta would update its meal service and add some new items. Going over to MUC the man behind me even commented to the flight attendant ""Is it the usual?"" It is always steak chicken breast pasta (no meat or fish - just pasta) and a cold plate. I've written to DL about adding fish lamb duck etc. to the rotation. (They actually had lamb on the MUC-ATL flight!) Even flight attendants say that every time they have ""fish"" it is the most ordered by passengers. I guess Michelle Bernstein has run out of ideas. That is my only suggestion to improve things in Business Elite: Get more imaginative on the meal offerings! It really isn't that difficult.",,,Business Class,,,4,5,4,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,7,Robert Coe,16th June 2014,"Round-trip flight from Quito Ecuador to Birmingham Alabama with one stop in Atlanta. The check in process was difficult since we are foreigners trying to leave the country. Nothing against Delta. The delta gate agents went through 3 security procedures before we even lined up to go to the plane. I think it was the airport's rules. I flew a Delta 757-200 to Atlanta on a red-eye flight. We took off around 11.40 pm and we started flying over the Pacific Ocean. There was no personal entertainment on this type of aircraft so we were forced to watch a movie. They started serving ""breakfast"" around 1.20 am. ""Breakfast"" was a cold turkey and mayonnaise sandwich fruit and a brownie. They took they tray away and we did not eat anything else. Around 5.00 am we started our descent into Atlanta. The landing was smooth and we soon de-boarded and headed through immigration to board our next 56 min flight to Birmingham. Atlanta airport is very confusing as to where restaurants and lounges are. We boarded our MD88 to Birmingham. Since it was an hour flight they should have served us something but the didn't. We landed in Birmingham smoothly.",,,Economy Class,,,4,3,3,3,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,,A Halpern,13th June 2014,Flight from NY La Guardia to Cleveland OH at 01.15am email said flight would be delayed by 2 hours. Delayed our taxi to airport by 2 hours. Got to airport to find flight now cancelled but no email communication from Delta no phone call just the pleasure of an extra 1.5 hours at the airport as they had rebooked us onto 3.20 flight. Staff no training in apologising to passengers for inconvenience - staff couldn't give a damn. Although travelling with my husband they couldn't be bothered to sit us together. So was the flight cancelled for bad weather? I don't think so. Too many additional reasons given eg staff not able to fly as on duty too long etc. We then discovered that the earlier flight had been cancelled too. Could this have been about consolidation. Advice don't travel with them if you can avoid them.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,Greg Fitzgerald,13th June 2014,Originally I had a 2 hour layover. Delta changed our flights to a 4 hour layover. The plane now has been delayed another 20 minutes so my family of 6 and I are at the airport right now for a 4.5 hour layover. This is not acceptable Delta should do something about this. Fly with an airline that cares. It's surely not Delta!,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,4,J Gardner,12th June 2014,We flew paid business class fares in Delta's Business Elite LAX to SYD and SYD to LAX in the forward B/E cabin on Delta's 777-200LR. We checked in using the kiosks in Delta's terminal and went through security quickly (we are both Global Entry/Precheck). The Delta SkyClub at LAX which doubles as Delta's business class lounge was crowded noisy and inferior in all respects to the business class lounges operated by other carriers to Australia we've flown on (ANZ and QF). For what it's worth Delta uses the ANZ business class lounge in Sydney and in all respects it's superior to Delta's SkyClub. The flight was delayed. Despite Delta's explanations the real reason for the constant late departures is that Sydney's airport operates under a curfew. It's the same problem coming back to LAX as ICE/Customs don't start clearing baggage/passengers until 8am - resulting in people sitting on the plane for a fair amount of time following arrival. Once in the air the flight itself was OK. The Delta flatbed seat on the 777-200 is adequate but inferior to the seats on ANZ's 777 and the QF A380 - both of those airlines provide business class passengers with a mattress that is laid over the top of the seat when reclined. The meal service both directions was in all respects inferior to business class meal services on ANZ QF and CX. The portions are tiny and the food itself is mediocre. The cabin crew LAX to SYD was OK but the crew returning SYD- LAX was disorganized distracted and not terribly personable. Delta's AVOD system on its 777 aircraft is antiquated. The pop-out monitors will not stay upright - many passengers around us had this problem. The moving map and flight information displays need to be updated. The headphones provided by Delta are supposed to be noise cancelling but don't work well (we both use Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headphones so it really didn't matter). Given the cost of business class tickets and all things being equal the only thing Delta has going for it on its 777 service to/from SYD is the privacy and relative quiet of its herringbone seating arrangement. Otherwise based on any other criteria you choose to use Delta's product is inferior compared to the other carriers we have flown on to/from Australia and New Zealand (ANZ QF and CX). We can't recommend Delta for business class to/from Sydney.,,,Business Class,,,3,2,1,2,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,9,A Whitehouse,12th June 2014,"I flew from Heathrow to Seattle. To be honest I was dreading the flight as I had read some really bad reviews of Delta. But it was excellent. The seat back screens were the biggest I have seen in Economy - with a great selection of films TV shows and music. The food whilst being obviously ""airline food"" was nice enough and lots of it. They listed only one meal - lunch - on the website but they served two more rounds of snacks throughout the flight - an ok sandwich and a really nice calzone. The staff were really friendly as well. Again I was dreading the service as a lot of other reviews mentioned their bad attitude. But the ones on my flight were lovely. Not sure if this is a sign of better things to come from Delta or by the fact that the route is brand new for them but it was a great flight.",,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,5,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,J Phillip,10th June 2014,I was a bit stubborn about flying Delta for the first time since I'm a fan of Frontier and I don't fly very often about once every three to four years. I took flight 1531 from MSP to BWI and I was very impressed. We left on time and the crew was friendly. After this experience I am very eager to fly Delta again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,D Wolters,9th June 2014,JFK-LHR. Had a great on time flight out of JFK with Delta. I found the service friendly and food was great. Constantly coming through the cabin with refreshments certainly not dehydrated at the end of the flight. Only criticism was when we were coming in to land into London the cabin crew did not ask passengers to raise their closed window blinds which made me feel a little unsafe sitting in the middle seats as I couldn't see what was going on outside during landing. The flight attendant told me after it's not US policy to raise the window blinds Delta why not just make it part of your safety policy. Would fly them again.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,William Reid,8th June 2014,My wife and I fly frequently and over the last couple of years have found ourselves on Delta a couple of times. Each of the prior trips found delays once missing a connecting flight due directly to the incompetence of Delta personnel. I wrote this off I. The past but today is the final straw. We flew from San Antonio to Atlanta to catch a connecting flight to Milan for a long awaited vacation. As we were boarding the 767 in Atlanta I noticed the port engine nacelle was open. Once we were buckled in the captain announced that maintenance was waiting on a part and it would take up to an hour to depart. An hour goes by and they have the part but they can't get it installed. Another hour goes by. They're still trying to fix it. More excuses more delays. Never again Delta this was strike three!,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,4,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,10,G Paul,8th June 2014,DL 1134 PBI-ATL. Great ground experience. Inbound flight late prior to equipment arrival gate agents asked for volunteers to check baggage at no charge to destination to speed up boarding and ease overheads. Turn around was 25 minutes gate arrival-departure. Plane was clean crew greeted boarding passengers with genuine smiles. They assisted loading overheads with no attitude. In flight they chatted with passengers. Crew even made the cart in aisle/trip to lav a pleasant game of I move/you move. I was in a time warp. Flying was fun. Three more flights on Delta that week were routine but what an experience this one flight was.,,,Premium Economy,,,4,5,4,1,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,S Kittle,5th June 2014,Our flight from Fairbanks to Minneapolis was a great flight with great service. On our return flights the service was great. However the flight was very hot.

I was dressed in sandals shorts T shirt.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,4,5,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,,Scerbo Paola,4th June 2014,On May 22 after a 6-hour delay 5 alerts and us waiting with hope at the terminal flight 5030 to Atlanta was canceled. And as per airport security and Delta counter the flight was canceled due to radar failure. This cancellation caused us to miss our connecting flight to Lima Peru. On same day Delta re-booked flight to Atlanta departing from another airport and for a later time. To get to this airport cost us $175.00. However once at the airport we begged to Delta to get us on a flight to Lima Peru instead Delta personnel there and over the phone made a mockery of our request by pretending to help us when in reality they were just wasting our time. In the meantime our newly re-booked flight was delayed for approximate 3 hrs and we arrived to Atlanta at midnight. Next day on 05/23 we finally traveled to Lima Peru but it was too late. We will never consider Delta for future travel.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,3,3,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,9,A Wong,2nd June 2014,Considering how Delta Airlines was an American Air carrier I initially wasn't expecting much and imagined that service would be mediocre sort of like Air Canada but to my surprise my Delta experience was great! Staff were polite the flights were punctual with my returning flight from MSP-YVR being about 15 minutes late due to a computer that needed replacement. Other than the fact that they should really replace/refurbish those A319s my flight was very pleasant.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,3,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,E Brown,1st June 2014,Travelled MSP-LHR AMS-MSP in May 2014. Flights were on time. Flight attendants responsive enough and food was okay.

Delta Air Lines,7,Gerasenkov Andrey,28th May 2014,JFK-LAX on a 757-200 in Business on May 17 angled seats with ample leg room excellent service then onward to HNL on a 757-300 in First: seats comparable to Premium Economy as far as the leg room goes poor recline the service was excellent though large screen IFE good food and drinks. May 25 HNL-LAX on an aged 767-200 in First same poor seat recline but good food and service old-style IFE. May 26 LAX-NYC on a 767-300ER Business Elite outstanding newly refurbished cabin flat bed seats outstanding food and service. The only complaint - never - ending turbulence but that was not airline's fault of course. To sum up Delta's First Class is not worth the money I will stick to premium economy instead in the future and the Business Elite is simply outstanding for a Domestic flight.,,,Business Class,,,4,5,3,5,,2,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,M Neave,27th May 2014,Third long haul flight with Delta LHR-ATL-TPA-ATL-LHR all flights on time first transatlantic flight they run out of food selections so only had pasta left which looked rather unappetising. Good selection of movies and games on the long haul flights seats were comfortable with good legroom. My only gripe is Atlanta airport why do you have to queue to go through security after getting off an international flight to connect with your next plane not Deltas fault but never had to do this before.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,3,5,,3,yes

Held up at JFK both ways for 12 hours due to weather not Delta's fault but our return connection to LHR was rebooked without our knowledge due to our late departure from DTW. This resulted in a rush to try and make the connection only to be told we were off the flight and rebooked for the following morning. Delta then did not issue us with the correct tickets resulting in a 4am nailbiter with Virgin check in as they tried to figure our what Delta had done. I am trying to plan my next trip to DTW to avoid Delta connections due to this.,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,,,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,7,S Andes,23rd May 2014,Travelled to London with my mom JFK-LHR via a Boeing 767-400ER on DL 403 which was an evening flight. Everything went very pleasant from food service to inflight entertainment seat comfort and cabin crew as well as cabin cleanliness. My complain would be our return flight which was rather a Boeing 767-300 aircraft. The Cabin was not clean and very narrow bathrooms have some odor and seats were comfortable even for a seven hour flight. Everything else went ok the crew looked exhausted and smiled less they were friendly and very caring. Also to mention food portions are quite small and selections must be thought carefully. If it was not for their 767-300 plane everything went very well. I prefer better other airlines notably American British Airways and Virgin Atlantic as a better option for economy especially with AA's B777-200ER which was their major upgrade.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,4,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,4,L Zipf,19th May 2014,"Very disappointed with Delta Airlines. I try to plan and budget for everything and was very irritated when I checked two bags for $25 each - Delta Advertises on the back of your ticket ""Your first checked bag is always free"" (within their recommended size and under 50lbs checked their website prior to our trip to avoid charges). I don't care if you charge me for my luggage but seriously don't advertise one thing and say another. If you book your tickets 6 months in advance and you pick your seats on that airplane and the plane is empty when you pick them you should at least be able to sit next to your significant other - but don't bother its a waste of time. Pleased with the flight crew and flight attendants kudos to them for positive attitudes. However I don't think I will be flying with delta anytime soon.",,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,3,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,2,Amarel Saieg,19th May 2014,"Boy are we never going to fly Delta ever again. Our first experience with Delta involved our honeymoon - they overbooked our flight to go to Jackson Hole so they re routed us to a different airport and set us up with a car service to take us to Jackson Hole (this delayed our trip about 5-6 hours and we were driving through Yellowstone Park in pitch black to our cabin). They also gave us Delta vouchers to put towards a ticket for our next flight. So we bought tickets to visit family overseas later with our vouchers and it was the biggest mistake of our lives. Our connecting flight was delayed because of weather- but they just kept pushing the time every 10 minutes making you think you would be able to really make it to our connecting international flight at JFK. We got on the plane 5 hours late and made it to the gate at JFK for our flight about 10 minutes before it was scheduled to depart. Well they didn't let us board the plane because they closed the door already (ok fine they said it was a security issue) so we watched our plane take off without us and mind you its already midnight at this point. So we are directed by the staff to go to the Delta counter so we did that. There was one woman at the desk that was eager to leave and she said that the next flight was overbooked by 16 people (no surprise we noticed that Delta tends to overbook their flights and basically makes people take one of their stupid vouchers just to re-experience Delta again) and that she could put us on a flight with one connection - but we would basically be getting to our destination 3 days later than we were originally supposed to. We are on vacation time off work and are going overseas to a country that is far away to see close family so every minute counts - she handed us what looked to be tickets but later we found out were just itineraries. So we could not go back through TSA to the ""nicer"" part of the terminal where there were comfortable chairs and food because we didn't have official tickets. Panic set in and were stranded at the airport with only 2 stalls available to go to the bathroom and no where to comfortably sit. My mom was able to get tickets for us on the flight that was supposedly overbooked and she was also told that we would get reimbursed for a hotel room should we choose to get one. There were no Delta agents at airport that could help us with anything. We contacted Delta to try to get reimbursed and we were sent in circles no manager available to help etc kept telling us to visit the Delta site and use the number there - even though we already did that they accused us of basically making up the fact that someone told us we would get reimbursed? So after 2 hours of getting no where we were fed up. Many other people I know have had bad experiences with Delta they warned us before we booked with them. I heard many people at the various airports we were at saying they will never fly Delta again and I agree.",,,Economy Class,,,3,1,2,4,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,9,T Tsai,18th May 2014,YUL-JFK-NRT-HKG. It was my first time flying Delta. I usually fly Japan Airlines or any other Asian airlines because of all the bad experiences I had with US based Airlines. From the check in agent I was greeted with a big smile. The planes were clean flight attendants full of energy and smile. To my surprise the captain apologize for the slight delay we had from JFK to Narita. That is something you hear only on Asian Airlines. The seats were comfortable for economy and the food was great!,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,1,Kara Clement,17th May 2014,Worst experience ever! Cancelled our connecting flight out of JFK leaving us stranded at their hell hole of a terminal for 20 hours and telling us that the next available flight was almost 3 days later. Employees spent their time sleeping chatting with one another or doodling on notepads. Bathrooms were disgusting. Every employee gave us different and conflicting information or showed no interest in helping us at all. Lost our bag and then told us that they wouldn't ship it to us we had to drive back to our final airport destination and pick it up. I will never fly with Delta ever again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,3,2,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,7,Brian Robinson,17th May 2014,Return leg of a paid first class ticket LAS-ATL-GSO. Seemed like circumstances were lining up to give my wife and I a major headache - Bad weather on the East Coast late (mechanical not weather) departure from LAS tight connection in ATL and no seats ex LAS going anywhere East. Helpful agent and supervisor booked hotel in ATL in case we misconnected but we didn't need to have worried a fine tailwind got us to ATL in time for our connection. Newer planes on these 2 legs; the aircraft on the LAS-ATL leg even had a rudimentary IFE system. However my joy was short lived as my headphone jack didn't work and I was denied the opportunity to watch reruns of a few TV programs. Food was fair (basically the same as the outbound journey) seat comfortable service attentive ground staff throughout helpful and efficient. I'll stick with Delta through this purple patch they are enjoying.,,,First Class,,,4,4,3,1,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,2,B Sayyar,17th May 2014,"All flights delayed some due to weather others to ""no staff for flight crew"". Missed all connection flights. Help desk staff extremely rude and condescending especially in JFK. Will never ever fly this airline again. Info given by crew 10 min before landing late regarding new gate and terminal incorrect.",,,Economy Class,,,2,2,2,3,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,7,G Stella,16th May 2014,The gate experience is good with staff pointing the way. This is especially good at Paris DeGaulle where there are endless gates and lines and confusion. Once on board the experience lessens as the attendants seemingly are frequently tired and occasionally indifferent. I have never been hot (not warm but hot as in a cabin temp of the high 70's) on an overseas flight. A request to a attendant brought the equivalent of a sleepy shrug. The food is edible and the presentation tries to be quality but it falls flat with the quality of the food and the occasional rush to serve and clear. I hate the business class pods - ok for the sleeper or someone doing work but impossible to talk or interact at all with a companion. Baggage handling is excellent for sky priority. Delta clubs vary from seedy (JFK) to nice. Nothing as nice as the Air France clubs at Paris CDG.,,,Business Class,,,4,3,2,4,,2,no

Delta Air Lines,7,Brian Robinson,16th May 2014,Paid for 1st class GSO-ATL-LAS. Delta continues to do a good job in their attempt to be a cut above the other Legacy airlines? Flights were on time check in and boarding easy food good. Service prompt and efficient if not jaunty. The flaw in the program in my view is the age and features of the equipment. DL's policy is to fly them until they run out of hours and our sky veterans had amassed 51 years between them! No IFE on either flight an ugly and not overly comfortable first class seat and 25 year old bathrooms - my ongoing pet peeve with DL.,,,First Class,,,3,3,4,,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,P Young,12th May 2014,I flew from YYZ to Detroit to Seoul I was sceptical at first flying Delta because of all the negative reviews. I am very pleased with the whole experience. Enough leg room great entertainment system and great food. I love the snack bags in the middle of the night and bottles of water. Little details really makes a huge difference the ear plug and eye cover warm wipes and cold wipes after boarding and when you wake up. Even the washroom is roomy. Flight attendants are efficient. I will definitely try to fly Delta whenever I can.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,P Bainbridge,8th May 2014,Flew PDX to AMS. Flight departed slightly late but actually arrived early. At check-in I enquired as to whether I could pay to upgrade myself to business class but they said they don't have such a program for last minute upgrades which was rather odd as other airlines regularly do it for a fee. Having said that in many ways I was glad I didn't as my normal economy seat was extremely comfy with loads of personal space. Delta has the best inflight entertainment system I have used with a massive selection of entertainment. Having said that they really need to do something about their meals as they were awful and almost as bad as Air Canada. I didn't eat my main course as it smelt awful food but was supposed to be beef stroganoff. The food was the only thing to let Delta down as their cabin crew were friendly and efficient making sure we had regular supplies of water to keep us hydrated. Id definitely fly Delta again but would order a special meal to see if said meal would be better.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,2,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,Logan Tresso,6th May 2014,Flying to Detroit From Tampa on a 737-800. Service on the plane: it was a good experience. Flight Attendants were polite and cared about me and other passengers (unlike United and BA). Food was only pretzels and cookies and a drink of choice (it was only a 2hr flight). Seats were comfortable. Service in the airport-Good service no long lines and friendly airport crew! I enjoyed Delta and will fly them again!,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,6,B Wijesinghe,5th May 2014,"DCA-ATL-DCA MD-90; Economy. ""We love to fly and it shows"" used to be Delta's slogan. Standards have slipped a lot since then. DCA counter bag drop-off was prompt after online check-in and the outbound flight was on time. It is amazing how many seats they have crammed into this aircraft recently to make money from Economy Comfort seats. The seat itself is reasonably comfortable for about two hours but the reduced legroom is awful. I am average height so I feel for taller people. Both planes were very clean and appeared well-maintained for 18+ year-old aircraft. A drink and mini pretzles were served on both flights. ATL bag drop-off after online check-in was quite quick. The inbound flight was delayed by 75 minutes but they made-up 25 minutes of that lost time. Flight attendants outbound were friendlier than those inbound. Overall this type of service will be acceptable for two to three hour flight segments and I will use Delta again.",,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,5,S Roessler,4th May 2014,We flew from Atlanta to Portland the check in process was chaotic and disorganized. We had checked in online but had not printed our boarding passes. One representative told us to leave the line and finalize the check in at the kiosk. We got out of line to do this and the kiosk was out of paper we got back in line and the same rep told us to go back to the kiosk - we refused. There was only one kiosk working at this time! The rep at the counter was much better informed and completed our check in within a couple of minutes. This kind of disorganization caused at least one customer I talked with to miss her flight! In addition there is so little leg room that it is ridiculous and so uncomfortable. I did not feel like the staff were very friendly or helpful. On a positive note our plane landed on time and our luggage was there too.,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,2,,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,8,K Williams,4th May 2014,Flew MAN-ATL-HNL and LIH-LAX-ATL-MAN in Business Elite/First. Outbound flatbeds on both legs although I found the 'herringbone' 330 better than the 'offset' 767. Food and drink good on both but I noticed that Delta have stopped their wonderful hot nuts on Business Elite (MAN-ATL) but they were still served on First (ATL-HNL). Return LIH-LAX was delayed 3.5 hours due to computer failure at LAX. Delta contacted us (unlike United) so we were able to delay our arrival at Kauai Airport (LIH). The 757 on this route was very tatty with a number of broken footrests and ought to be retired. We made the connection at LAX and ATL and arrived at MAN 30 minutes early. Refreshments on the two First segments were acceptable and excellent on Business Elite. The staff on all flights were very attentive.,,,Business Class,,,4,5,5,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,J Katnic,4th May 2014,Flight 387 from GUA to LAX on 4/26/2014. Delta procedures at GUA appalling! Each time I fly back on this route things get worse. It appears that you can no longer check in at a counter. After taking our 6 bags to the check in counter we were told to go back to kiosks to do our check in while the Delta employees sat around. If this was a domestic flight I would say there would be no issue. The fact that you have to attempt scanning of passports makes things a bit more difficult especially if you're not used to it. This process took an additional 20 minutes for the 4 of us. As the check in area isn't air conditioned the extra wait time left us sweaty and fed-up by the time we made it to the gate. Plane was late coming in. While waiting in the boarding line we looked to find that 3 of 4 seats had been changed. We went back to the ticket desk at the gate and fortunately were able to get our old seats back. By the time we got onto the plane and took our seats it was apparent that Delta lets babies travel in the first class cabin. The next 6 hours on the plane were frequently interrupted by a two year old that couldn't be controlled by her mother. The flight attendants tried to pacify the child but stopped short of requesting the mother take her child back to economy with the rest of her family. The screaming child aside cabin crew service was great. My four year old was again able to visit the cockpit but found little to do afterwards a this 757-200 only had communal IFE. Either watch the screen in front of the plane or watch nothing else: none of the music stations worked either. Food so-so but drink/snack runs frequent. If a drink/snack was requested in-between nothing was too much trouble. The final act of the Delta ground crew was to bus us to the Bradley Terminal after landing. It took 2 hours from the time the plane landed until we got our bags and I was surprised they were still on the carousel once clearing customs. After all most other international flights come through this terminal. The morning flight always has customs clearance at Terminal 5. If flying Delta was all one had to do it might not be such a bad experience as the flight crews are great. It's the pre post and sometime in-flight policies that Delta management have dreamt up that will make me never fly Delta on this route again. We paid for these tickets as opposed to upgrading so to say we were let down is an understatement. Next time it will be Taca/Avianca.,,,Business Class,,,3,4,3,1,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,2,A Bastien,4th May 2014,May 1 2014 Washington DC (DCA) to Minneapolis St. Paul (MSP). I bought an economy class ticket but Delta gave me an economy plus seat. Economy plus had a little more legroom and padding than economy but the seat recline was almost the same as in economy - I couldn't tell the difference. Based on this experience I would not pay extra for economy plus. Delta charged $2.00 for headsets with which to listen to a movie displayed on overhead screens situated every 4-6 rows. I didn't buy the headsets or food so I can't comment on catering or entertainment. Boarding has turned into an unpleasant experience passengers crowding the gate so they can board first and secure overhead bin space. My flight experience deteriorates each time I fly Delta. My spouse is a Platinum frequent flyer which is the only reason I patronize this airline -- no cost award tickets. I can't wait to fly Southwest or Jet Blue (domestic) or Air France KLM Lufthansa international. It seems as though the smiling CEO on the inflight video has nothing but contempt for his economy class passengers.,,,Premium Economy,,,2,4,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,3,M Chiesa,3rd May 2014,Flight DL0187 Date: Apr 25 2014. More expensive than other airlines. Lunch was served at 10am GMT 2 hours after departure! They had a lot of time to serve it later as we still had more than 5 hours ahead (going to Boston MA USA). You had to pay for entertainment. Many empty seats in first row but you cannot take them without paying extra! Attendant was chatting too much and very loudly and I couldn't sleep. Many broken seats won't come back to straight vertical position. They didn't have any diet or light soda but Fresca.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,4,2,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,10,D Stankay,3rd May 2014,Flight 67 to Atlanta connecting to flight 1384 to Orlando on April 28. My mother returned home from Zurich to Orlando after visiting us in Europe. Unfortunately while here she spent time in the hospital. Various Delta employees with whom we were in contact were extremely helpful in rebooking flights and assisting her before during and after her flights including wheelchair support. She enjoyed the flight (in economy comfort) the service the food etc. As a family we have flown Delta during many years and continue to be impressed with the airline more so recently with the many improvements they have and are implementing. We will happy continue to recommend Delta airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,5,James Sturdevant,3rd May 2014,Just returned from: IND to SJU via ATL. First class on IND-ATL segments (MD 90) and so-called Business Elite on ATL-SJU segments (737-800). On all segments aircraft interiors were clean and well maintained and cabin attendants were good. Boarding on all flights was total chaos and food on the ATL-SJU segments was inedible. No food on other segments. Seats not what one would call comfortable or roomy. Not worth the price paid.,,,First Class,,,3,4,1,2,,,no
Delta Air Lines,1,A Bastien,3rd May 2014,April 27th overnight flight from San Francisco (SFO) to Washington Reagan (DCA) with stopover in Detroit (DTW). Economy seats on flight from SFO to DTW were extremely uncomfortable: hardly any legroom - very little padding no padding on armrests and minimal recline. These are the worst airline seats I've experienced. Delta offered a thin blanket but no pillow. I was unable to sleep. The economy seats from DTW to DCA had slightly more recline and were therefore tolerable. Delta didn't offer food for purchase on these flights and I didn't pay the $2.00 for a headset on the SFO to DTW flight so I am unable to rate food or entertainment (I gave Delta one star for each).,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,J Limen,1st May 2014,The food was disgusting and the fact that I was travelling from the UK to the USA and there was no entertainment was horrendous. My kids had to look at the front of a seat for 8 hrs and my daughter had to sit on my lap but she could not sit properly because there was no space. When we got given food it kept going everywhere because we were so squashed. The loos were dirty and small. The staff were no good they didn't help out. I wouldn't recommend them.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,2,D Stewart,30th April 2014,Flew Atlanta to Seattle. It is a 5 hour flight. If you want to eat you have to buy your meal however they do not have enough sandwiches so when the cart got to the end of the plane there was nothing left. If you want to watch a movie you have to pay $6.00. It costs $30.00 to check each bag. Just be aware that the price you pay for your ticket is just to get you from a to b just like greyhound.,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,1,1,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,10,Mark Ackery,29th April 2014,Flew from LAX-ATL on B777-200 then ATL-CMH on A319. Both legs were great and crew very attentive. First class seat on the B777 was a comfortable seat if somewhat difficult to settle into at first. The A319 was uncomfortable and took a while to find that special spot to get comfortable. All considered the service I got for what I paid was excellent. Bags were first off the carousel and waiting when I got there which I liked a lot. Only issue was the miserable check in lady in LAX. DL also need to re think their lounge policy for First class passengers.,,,First Class,,,4,5,4,3,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,2,Kim Grewe,28th April 2014,The review is for Delta which was our return flight home from Pittsburgh. We were to leave on Flight DL 5217 on 20 April. Delta Airlines has a poor fleet of plains. They were under staffed and had 2 mechanical breakdowns and were unable to find us other flights. We needed to be home for surgery the next day and paid extra to fly out on Easter. Because we booked with Expedia they said that they Delta was not to blame (they blamed United). Worst case of passing the buck ever! (Only bright spot were the front line staff - like the desk agents who remained 3 hours extra to rebook all the passengers).,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,3,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,10,Ellis Bob,28th April 2014,MAN-Atlanta Atlanta-Memphis Memphis-Las Vegas Las Vegas-Salt Lake City Salt Lake City-Memphis Memphis- Detroit Detroit-Amsterdam April 2014. All of our America trip was with Delta and everyone was excellent in every way. From check in to boarding to seat leg room were superb. The pilot and cabin crew were so friendly the captain thanked everyone on each flight personally standing at the entrance with the cabin crew. 7 out of our 8 holiday flights were with delta and we had no problems with any one was with KLM see that review.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,5,C McCarthy,27th April 2014,Travelled Dublin to Salt Lake return trip. I normally travel BA which is good but in comparison Delta is a horrible travel experience. The flight attendants are fine but the aircraft used on all four segments were very old and there was a 'domestic' feel to flight that you just don't get with BA which in comparison has newer and cleaner and more spacious aircraft. Perhaps the biggest issue was that Delta typically fly 757 aircraft compared to BA's use of 747 or A380. It just felt far too cramped for long haul. The biggest insult was having paid > $2000 for a return flight to being given a 'beaker' of 100% plonk despite having asked for 'red wine'. I really wanted a glass of wine but if there was a plant nearby I would have dumped it there it was absolutely foul - I'm not a wine snob and would drink anything reasonable but this drink poured from a large container was sickening. I'd fly Delta again but only as a last resort. Having said that the flights were all on time or early maybe lucky but I'd hate to be delayed if the only wine they had onboard in 'coach' was what they gave me on those flights. One more thing although they had VOD the content on offer was very limited with only a handful of movies on offer (in contrast BA usually offer > 30 movies with similar ratios for TV and Music).,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,1,2,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,Matthew Carrell,27th April 2014,Flight from Atlanta to Jacksonville NC canceled due to mechanical problem. Their solution was to spend the night in Atlanta at our cost and fly to Jacksonville 20 hours later. Ended up fling to Raleigh and renting a car at our cost and driving to Jacksonville. They are not concerned in the least. Will avoid Delta in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,3,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,2,Carol Pollis,22nd April 2014,Flight from MSN to LGA going east was very good. Return west was very poor with cancellation of late night flight and re-booking for next morning and long (2.5 hours) delay on morning flight due to a mechanical problem after plane was loaded and de-icing equipment issue in Mid-April at LGA. Very long and stressful flight experience.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,9,D Cooper,21st April 2014,Flew LHR-JFK and connecting internal flights to MCO. Excellent service at the airport and onboard. Very helpful and friendly cabin crew on all legs of the journey. Planes were clean and comfortable despite being a little old. Flight crews were very informative about potential turbulence flight times etc. There was a good selection of up to date movies and TV series available on personal entertainment screens for the long haul parts. Cabin crew would frequently offer drinks served dinner and a breakfast plus newspapers and other amenities on this section. Punctual and a pleasant experience. Would definitely fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,7,P McDonnell,16th April 2014,Madison WI to Gainesville FL via Atlanta. Flight delayed by a few hours leaving Madison. There was a decent snowstorm going on at the time and I presumed that was the cause of the delay. Arrived late in Atlanta and just missed the connecting flight to Gainesville. Delta staff at Atlanta said the delay was actually due to mechanical reasons and promptly provided meal and hotel vouchers for an excellent hotel and rebooking on the first flight the following morning. Obviously the delayed flight is a negative but in this particular case Delta efficiently made adequate accommodations for stranded passengers in a situation where it would have been easy for them to blame the weather and refuse to make accommodations at all. For that they deserve some commendation.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,3,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,,U Guest,15th April 2014,Horrible service horrible planes Delta does not care about their passengers. No matter what happens they only have on excuse - technical problems with the plane. I booked my flights with Delta because the price is usually $30-50 cheaper but I've learned my lesson - it's not worth it. (I fly about 10 times a year and have done so for last 6 years) I don't remember their flight being ever on time. They've failed 100 out of 100 times. I wish everyone would stop flying with them just to show them that in order to stay in business they have to take care of their customers.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,A Galiano,14th April 2014,I have flown Delta for 20 years and the last few have become completely horrible. The company does not appear to care about the customer any longer. The seats have shrunk to petite size on most flights and I am fairly thin. My knees are in the back of the seat in front of me when I am in coach. The flights are consistently late on departure and arrival. The flights are typically oversold which creates a capacity issue for their service. As a frequent flyer and a business person I can understand the need to increase operating margins but at what cost? I think the executive team should eat their own dog food and ride non-private flights. I am considering abandoning my gold status at Delta for an airline that can do more than lip service.,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,E Dunn,14th April 2014,Booked on Delta flight out of a local regional airport MLI to New Bern North Carolina via connection in Atlanta. Flight was scheduled to depart at 4.59pm. It was pushed back to 7.30 as the incoming flight out of Atlanta has mechanical problems and they were bringing in another plane. Flight delayed a second time to 8.39pm and cancelled. Both at the delay and cancellation the customers had to leave the secure area and go back out to the ticket counter. We were told the flight was cancelled because the crew timed out. All flights on Delta out of Chicago and United were booked. They have no reciprocating agreement with Southwest or U.S. Air and could not see their reservation. Delta told us to come back the next day at 4.50 for that flight. We finally via the internet were able to book a flight earlier the next day out of Chicago with U.S. Air for $400 more than the original ticket. We had purchased insurance through Alliance. Delta would only refund the ticket price and would not pay the difference. The people at the ticket counter were less than helpful they had given up and didn't care. I won't be flying Delta again not if I can help it at least. U.S air was on time and staff was very friendly.,,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,8,Adam Khan,13th April 2014,I went DTW-SFO AND SFO-DTW. Took Delta Airlines Boeing 767-300 both ways. The seat comfort was great! There was a lot of leg room. The staff wasn't very friendly. They weren't smiling that much or very polite. There was a lot of food selection and prices were decent. We got complimentary drinks twice which was great. The inflight entertainment system has a ton of selection although most of the movies and tv shows cost money. But the music selection was amazing so it was great. Overall the Delta flights were really good and I would definitely fly it again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,3,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,3,M Schuwer,13th April 2014,"AF3628 (operated by Delta) Paris-NY JFK 6th April. Extremely disappointed with Delta the only normal element was that the flight was on time. The staff service was not pleasant and not helpful. The lavatory (even before taking off) was dirty. No newspapers (we'll give you whatever will be left after business class passengers have been served). The food was appalling and a horrible non-descript sandwich (which almost everyone put aside) should not be called a ""meal"". What a trip.",,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,2,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,,M Moffett,8th April 2014,"Extremely dissatisfied with Delta. Original flight delayed with no explanation. Missed connecting flight by 5 minutes. The next flight I was able to get on and still make my appointment at my destination - at boarding time was advised of ""mechanical issues"" and not sure of length of delay.

Delta Air Lines,8,E Sauerwein,8th April 2014,I fly international in economy class from Seattle (SEA) to Japan (NRT) about twice every month. I have flown this route more than 10 times already and with a variety of different airlines. At first I was sceptical about flying with Delta but Delta has made up a lot of ground recently in my opinion. While Delta is no match for Singapore airline's service and no match for ANA's food it does beat out United airlines in both of these categories. One major problem I have with Delta's international flight is that they really only served one meal whereas Singapore and ANA gave you a full 2 meals. Over a 9-10 hour flight having only one major meal feels a little lacking and will leave you hungry walking off the plane. The food that is served is also not exciting but gets the job done. In-flight entertainment is good with plenty of choices and nice screen size/brightness. I fly often so this is particularity important especially over such a long segment. Seat comfort is mediocre but its economy so you get what you pay for however I have used Premium Economy seating with Delta and I'd have to say its worth the few extra $. If flying ANA on this segment on a 787 Dreamliner your Regular Economy seating will outclass Deltas Premium Economy seats however. To rap up I'd say since Delta is usually 100$ cheaper than the other competitors mentioned above you really get what you pay for.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,Ian Sinclair,2nd April 2014,DL010 ATL-LHR on 7th March. Very tight connection from Dallas through Atlanta made the flight with minutes to spare and my bags made it onto the flight too! Extremely attentive cabin staff comfortable lie flat bed good selection of food and drink IFE was a little dated but didn't mind as was tired and needed the sleep. Flight arrived early quick bag delivery. All round great experience.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,3,,5,yes

Delta Air Lines,9,Hendrik Oberbeckmann,30th March 2014,Our flight from LAX to JFK was on time and we arrived earlier than planned.

Delta Air Lines,8,E Biafore,30th March 2014,Economy Comfort DTW-LAX on a 767-300 and LAX-DTW on a 737-900. To LAX the 767-300 seat was good although it did not have the adjustable headrest. Multiple drink runs and plenty of cookies peanuts and pretzels. Personal entertainment had okay choices. Back to DTW the 737-900 was great. Seats were very comfortable. Again multiple drink runs and lots of snacks. Purchased the fruit/cheese tray and tapas both of which were very good. The personal entertainment had tons of movies. Overall - very good experience. I hope that all aircraft get seats with adjustable headrests as they do make a difference on a 4+ hour flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,3,Kaval Lodhie,26th March 2014,"I flew LA to NYC on a red-eye flight this past Sunday March 23rd. The boarding process was an absolute nightmare and that was in part due to some horrible service (more to come). More than 15 people had to check in their bags and all passengers in Economy that could keep their luggage on board were having to put their belongings aisles down in the bins creating a huge mess upon landing. While entering the plane and attempting to put our things away we were ""greeted"" by an extremely sarcastic condescending and ""rudely-friendly"" air hostess who would individually call out any person taking longer than 15 seconds to put away their things. After embarrassing quite a few passengers including myself who were tired and exhausted and about to take a 6 hour red-eye she proceeded to call one passenger ""cute very handsome"" and helped him out by putting his luggage in first class. A few minutes later after everyone else was told to check in their bags a mother came in with a son with special needs stated she had to keep her luggage on board because his medicines and change of clothes were all in there and the hostess proceeded to tell her there's nothing she can do except give her a bag for her medicines. After take-off (which was 25 minutes late) the passengers proceeded to sleep (as one does past midnight) and the air hostesses (namely the sarcastic one) proceeded to talk at full volume inconsiderate of the passengers. As a side note the other hostesses were quite nice. After 6 hours on a rather uncomfortable seat we started our decent with yet again the sarcastic hostess picking out her two favorite passengers and offering them secret mimosas while the rest of us looked on. Not a good experience pretty frustrating and undoubtedly embarrassing.",,,Economy Class,,,2,1,3,,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,1,Mary Wickens,26th March 2014,Paid $622 for so-called Sky Priority First Class from Detroit to Tampa. What a joke! My checked bag was taken off the non-stop because they were overweight. I guess Sky Priority means they ditch your bag before everyone else. Planes are filthy. First class lavatory filthy. First class crowded with coach passengers using forward lavatory. No attempt by FAs to deter this. First overheads filled with coach luggage. Several first class flights last year on AA were terrific also first on Icelandair - also terrific. Save your money - Delta is now a low cost low service airline do not bother to pay for First class.,,,First Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,W Powell,26th March 2014,3/24/14 I was set to departing from Atlanta to Greensboro NC on flight DL4933 and returning from Greensboro NC to Atlanta on DL1461. Upon boarding I noticed that there was a climate issue on the flight where half of the plane was extremely cold and the back half of the flight was unbearably hot. I was not the only passenger to complain to no avail to the flight staff. After about 30min on the runway with no movement we were notified that there was an engine malfunction and all passengers would need to depart the aircraft. We were told at 8.50am that the maintenance would take an hour at the most. It is now 10.33am and there has been no resolution to the situation. The ladies at the customer care center across from D27 have been the only people to attempt to assist me. I attempted to inform the representatives at the departure gate (D13) that I was attempting to go to a funeral and any options would be appreciated and they stated that they understood and asked me to take a seat and wait. As a result of my flight not being ready to depart Atlanta at 10.40am and the viewing in Winston-Salem NC beginning at 11.00am I was unable to pay my respects.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,8,Sean Kyte,24th March 2014,Flew Washington to London via Atlanta. Flight from Washington to Atlanta was fine drinks service and pretzels provided however bad weather meant the service was suspended. Annoying the flight was full and warnings were given about hand luggage due to the flight being full however quite a lot of other passengers had loads of luggage including massive cases that would normally be checked in. Flight from Atlanta to London was fine meal service delayed due to bad weather but meal was tasty and full drinks service offered. On demand TV with good selection would definitely fly Delta again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,Steve Tait,24th March 2014,BOS-ATL-LIM-ATL-BOS in Business Class. Flight experience was excellent. Great crews very comfortable lay-flat bed seating wonderful IFE superb meals. Additionally very good wines offered. I have never had aged wines on a flight before. The return from LIM to ATL was canceled due to a mechanical issue and DL had to fly the part down on their flight from ATL the next day. DL did a commendable job accommodating the over 200 passengers. Excellent pro-active customer service. The only part of this trip that was any type of letdown was the Club in ATL in Terminal E. The Club was packed the seating awkward and uncomfortable the food offerings pretty bad and the Wifi so slow it was unusable. The BOS Club was great however. All in all a very good experience yet again with DL.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,2,Sauvageau Gilles,22nd March 2014,Flew Jan 22 from Burlington VT to Tampa FL. They changed planes giving us a smaller one so they ran out of seats they offered compensation took the flight up to Atlanta GA. No heating on plane we were freezing attendants kept there coats on for the trip. No hot drinks peanuts pretzels or soft drinks. Next flight to Tampa was ok on way back the plane land in LaGuardia NY put us onboard waited an 1 hour before leaving while the plane was being de-iced they had only one truck there to de-ice 3 planes. They compensate us with peanuts and pretzels - very disappointed with Delta.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,1,3,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,8,T Lammers,17th March 2014,Flew CZM to ATL. We were supposed to leave on 28th January but didn't end up leaving until 30th January. This obviously wasn't the airlines fault so you cannot give them a worse score for the weather. We were complimentary upgraded to business class on this flight but since the plane had landed the night prior they didn't have the hot meal we received on the way down. They did however give us all the cookies and chips and any other snacks they had. Along with liquor. The seats were very comfortable and the flight attendants were very courteous. Overall a great flight.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,3,,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,T Lammers,17th March 2014,Flew GSO to CZM through ATL. We received complimentary upgrades to business class. The meal was the best meal I have had on a plane and the sandwich and puree would have rivalled sandwich shops. Everything was excellent. The seats were comfortable and the flight attendants were helpful and courteous. Highly recommend.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,Suanne Wymer,17th March 2014,Our flight to Tulsa has been delayed for almost 5 hours. During this time we have not been given satisfactory updates. We've only been told mechanical difficulties. 5 hours later they are still trying to decide if they will bring another plane. I will not fly Delta in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,10,T Matava,17th March 2014,DL1467 13 Mar ATL-SAN. Flight operated with 767 equipment. As with all DL west coast flights medallion upgrades limited to a very few high Diamonds (I am a platinum medallion and was about 17 on the list for 5 upgrade seats). However the Economy Comfort seat was quite comfortable but more importantly the inflight service was superb. Flight time was 4hrs 15mins and the somewhat senior cabin crew provided non-stop service. Two drink runs water in between and a flight attendant always in the aisle. Special requests fulfilled graciously. This was true Delta service from the heart and was to me a benchmark of what DL can be. Even though I am a Million Miler I was impressed by one of the best flights I have had.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,T Lammers,17th March 2014,Flew DL007 from DXB to ATL. I have traveled this flight 12 or more times. Most of the time my experience is always positive. This specific trip the IFE was not working very well for the first 3+ hours of the flight. They had to reset the system about 4 or 5 times. I was seated in 44J (Exit row window seat). I always sit in Row 44 which is the row with nothing in front of you. I am a frequent flyer so I have this option. The food was decent. The mid flight snack is normally just a turkey sandwich and a mini banana. You can normally get one drink with your meal just ask for it. The flight attendants are very kind every time on this flight. Sometimes you get a joker too. The bathrooms always become quite disgusting but that's understandable on a 15 hour flight. I enjoyed my flight but will be flying Business class with my miles next flight.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,3,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,C Shulman,14th March 2014,Rochester to Ft Lauderdale through Atlanta 3/6/14 - 3/9/14. I was very happy with two aspects and unhappy with one. We taxied from the gate in Atlanta found there were tornadoes in Florida and turned back to the gate. The speed with which we were told what happened and with which Delta decided to bring us back to the gate were beyond anything I've recently experienced from the airlines. I was very impressed with the kindness and quick solution when I got home after the trip realized I left a book on the plane called the airport held it for me and I got it back two days later. My one complaint was with the one hour line to get through TSA at 5 am March 9 in Ft Lauderdale-I think Delta blames this on TSA. Overall very satisfied with Delta.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,5,Anthony Austin Jr,12th March 2014,PHL-CDG-PHL on a Boeing 757ER. Went on a family vacation to Paris back in July 2013. Leaving Philly the flight left on time at 9pm and got to Paris 30 minutes early around 10.15am. Flight wasn't full so I went to an empty row to lay down for the almost 8hr flight. Each seat had TV's in the headrest and the plane had wifi but flying over the Atlantic ocean the wifi didn't. The food served wasn't the best and the complimentary breakfast was a joke they gave us OJ a banana and a blueberry muffin. Leaving Paris we had an hour delay because of a storm and when we finally boarded the plane we had another half hour delay because a family of 10 had a virus and were all forced to get off. My original seat flying from Paris was changed without any notification prior to the vacation. Luckily my mother checked the flights each day to make sure nothing bad happened to our flights. The flight was full minus the family who got kicked off the plane. For the almost 8hr flight you would think they would use a 2 aisle plane instead of one. My TV didn't work. For long haul flights I doubt I'll take Delta again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,2,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,10,V Widdis,12th March 2014,Feb 25th flight DL4884 DL4938 / March 4TH DL5355 DL892 DL4682. I had not ever flown with Delta before last week. I have been very impressed with the customer service as well as the price. Atlanta airport was daunting first time round but the second visit was much easier to work through.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,3,G Smith,3rd March 2014,Flight 2395 PBI-LGA on a MD-88 aircraft on July 30th. Only positive was an on time flight. Thankful this flight wasn't any longer then it was. Experience was awful and I felt very unwelcome as if I was an inconvenience. Flight crew were young and seemed new to the airline industry. I assumed they'd be into their job and enthusiastic I experienced the complete opposite. No hello or goodbye while entering and deplaning the aircraft by any crew member. Ticket scanner while boarding was not working so the rude gate agent was checking the tickets by hand. Crew rushed through the safety announcement and we were in the air within 5 minutes. Ok legroom however the armrests where painful to rest your arm on. Restrooms in rear were out of order leaving everyone on the plane to have to all use the one restroom in first class. Took about 30 minutes to receive my luggage at baggage claim. Overall not a pleasant experience.,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,1,,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,,P Ferguson,3rd March 2014,"I have flown Delta for years because I live in metro Detroit. I am a frequent flyer and am in many ways ""stuck"" but after this experience I am going to find an alternative.

Delta Air Lines,10,Catherine Garrett,27th February 2014,I was travelling with my teenage son and 3 others on a flight to Boston. We received excellent service from everyone. The attendants encouraged our tall teenage boys to move to seats with more legroom as the flight was not full and supplied them with all the refreshments they asked for with a smile. They gave us great advise for when we landed. Extra cups of tea were not a problem and also came with delicious cookies! Our return flight a week later was even better with the same crew who were interested in our trip and how we had got on with the snowstorms. They again encouraged us to move for more room and once again all refreshments were served with a smile.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,P Parson,25th February 2014,Long and short of it is that it took a succession of 5 aircrafts last week to get from Detroit to Burlington VT. The first plane which left on time backed into a baggage cart. They couldn't find a crew for the replacement. Ended up spending the night in Detroit (at my expense) the 1st and 2nd aircraft the next morning both had mechanical issues. Customer Service in Detroit for the most part is the worst I've ever seen. Rude uninformed incompetent etc. Thanks to a fellow passenger who told me that a flight to Burlington had 14 empty seats I got home on aircraft #5. I usually fly Delta and have generally found their service to be very good. However they need to address the Customer Service issues in Detroit.,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,8,John Brown,22nd February 2014,"Flew from Seattle to Vegas on a ""cosy"" CRJ900. Service was friendly seat comfortable and snacks and drinks on offer were good for a 1hr 45min.

Delta Air Lines,7,K Benting,22nd February 2014,DL002 London Heathrow to JFK 15th Feb returned on 21st Feb flight KL6005 JFK to London Heathrow. This is the first time I have used Delta Airlines. The value for money was great. The meals were some of the best I have tasted inflight with a good selection. The entertainment was also extremely good with a vast selection to choose from. The staff were not warm and friendly and the plane was not cleaned to a great standard there were peanuts down the side of the chair that had been there for some time. The staff did not know who their partnership airlines were and we were advised to go to a different terminal due too this. Flying home from JFK seats were not allocated until the gate meaning on a night flight my daughter was on the opposite side of the plane to myself.,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,Kupper Julia,21st February 2014,Feb 7 2014. Frankfurt (Germany) to NYC (USA). All in all I had one of the best long distance flights in a while. The plane itself was new leg space was a lot better than for instance on Air Berlin flights. The safety video was the funniest I had seen. Delta definitely had the greatest selection of films I have seen on the plane although some of them had Russian/Chinese/Korean subtitles but I wasn't disturbed by that. I know a flight is not all about food but I was surprised by the variety of things served. The crew were generally very friendly and served the first round of drinks approximately an hour after take off followed by snacks (pretzels and salted peanuts) a fantastic hot lunch (chicken/rice/vegetables) and tea/coffee straight afterwards. The next round of snacks (same than before) was served a few hours later and 1.5 hours before landing we even got another meal this time a hot tomato-mozarella sandwich followed by ice-cream. I would certainly recommend flying with Delta.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,1,Peter Davidson,21st February 2014,After visiting Tucson AZ I was embarking on my return journey from Tucson to Edinburgh via Atlanta and Paris on Monday 17th Feb. The incoming flight from Atlanta arrived more or less on time but as soon as it landed it was clear there was a problem with the aircraft. It turns out that none of the lavatories were functional. This caused a severe delay making me reschedule my entire journey one day later. I was offered a hotel - which was fine - and given what was described to me as meal vouchers. These were not fine. They were in fact practically useless pieces of paper. No one took the time to explain that they were only valued at $6. A fact I was also unaware of until I came to pay and pay I did. As far as I am concerned if I am given a meal voucher I expect a meal. In fact this worthless piece of paper does not buy anything on the menu - even a bowl of soup. To add insult to injury there was no breakfast voucher at all. American airlines already have a bad reputation so perhaps I should not have expected better.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,3,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,,E Steven,21st February 2014,"Was scheduled from Milwaukee to Detroit to Norfolk VA on Thursday 2/13. Our plane in MKE was delayed over an hour because of weather. Because of that we missed our connection to Norfolk. The captain said we'd be rebooked on the next flight - we weren't. My three traveling companions and I couldn't be rebooked until Saturday 2/15 after our event was over. Delta's customer ""service"" area in the Detroit airport consist of a bank of phones with no human beings present. We were continually bounced between phone representatives and gate agents with neither being helpful. We ended up renting a car and driving (yes over 12 hrs) Avoid Delta at all costs.",,,Economy Class,,,3,1,2,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,2,Robert Wills,18th February 2014,DL 1169 MIA to LAX Feb 13 2014. It is impossible to get an upgrade as a Platinum Medallion between Florida and California on Delta. In addition the system wide upgrades are never available. Furthermore the planes are smaller always packed. After flying 2.5 million miles with Delta it clearly has gone downhill. Loyalty means nothing. If you fly from Florida to California often and need to try and do some work on the trip avoid Delta. Their upgrade policy is a classic bait and switch. My trip yesterday was like a 5 hour closed MRI. It is sad to see great airline go down the tubes in rewarding loyalty.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,2,1,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,3,Bastien Antoine,17th February 2014,"February 1 2014. CDG (Paris) to SEA (Seattle-Tacoma). I would have given Delta a higher score an 8 out of 10 for trip satisfaction but the seats on the aircraft were very uncomfortable (the worst I've experienced). The recline was minimal which made it impossible for me to sleep. I had to remove the catalogue / inflight magazine from the seat pocket in front of me in order to gain a 1/2 inch or so of leg space. I considered upgrading to economy comfort but only available seats were by the toilets and the seats were described as having ""up to"" 4 inches of additional leg room but no mention of additional recline. The seats are acceptable short flights but not for long-haul travel.",,,Economy Class,,,1,4,3,5,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,,Colmcille Bright,17th February 2014,"I recently flew to Fort Wayne from Philly. Both ways had a lay over so I flew 4 separate planes. Of the 4 I had a broken seat on 3 of them. Not able to recline on 2 because it was broken and the other I had a broken seat cushion that repeatedly slid off making the flight that much more comfortable as I had to keep standing and fixing it. At least I was able to enjoy a beverage. Oh no I was not because 2 flights did not serve any and the last leg of my journey the 3 flight ""attendants"" were unable to fully serve the plan in the 70 min we were in the air. I have taken 20 min flights in Europe where I get served fresh tea and a biscuit by one flight steward for the entire plane. If ever have the displeasure of flying your airline I will be sure to bring duck tape a tool box and a coke so I can be comfortable.",,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,,,,no
Delta Air Lines,7,Alan McEneaney,10th February 2014,I flew from DUB-JFK-PHX. The transatlantic leg was enjoyable. The flight attendants did several drink runs although they only pour half a can unlike other airlines. Each passenger had their own personal backseat TV and the movie/music/game selection was fantastic. Headphones are provided for those didn't bring their own. Toilets were clean and hot towels are provided to freshen up. The second leg from JFK-PHX was less impressive. Entertainment is provided by an old CRT monitor in the centre of the aisle meaning you have no choice in what you watch. Expect old sitcom reruns. No meals on this flight either despite it being nearly as long as DUB-JFK. The boredom of this flights combined with my hunger meant I couldn't wait to get off. Conclusion: fly Delta transatlantic but avoid for domestic flights within the USA.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,3,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,4,Pym Mark,10th February 2014,Flew JNB-ATL-SNA on Feb 6 2014. Departure from JNB on time though boarding was a bit chaotic. Economy class seating on B77L from JNB-ATL ok. Weber slimline seats are a quite firm and this becomes ever more evident on this long 16 hour flight. Cabin crew most unfriendly and really did not want to be providing the on board services. In flight meals very poor. Cabin crew on ATL-SNA flight a little better. AVOD on B77L very good with excellent picture quality and selections.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,4,,4,no
Delta Air Lines,10,M Liebmann,10th February 2014,ATL-DUB Delta 176 in business class leaving Atlanta on November 22 and returning November 30 Delta 177. The food was fantastic and filling. I liked the fact that there was a great selection of entrees both for the main meal and the meal prior to landing. The seat sort of reminded me of L'Espace Affaires on Air France in 2007. That said it was very comfortable. The only downside is that I was unable to sleep. The flight crew going to Dublin was nothing short of fantastic. The flight crew returning was great but not as good as the outgoing crew. The in- flight entertainment was OK. While I didn't explore as much on the outgoing flight I was able to watch 3 movies I had not seen on the return flight. The only real downside is that it cost me nearly double the frequent flier miles to fly for free than it had cost me when I flew Delta to Dublin in 2000. All in all a very positive experience.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes

The first flight had an engine problem over the Atlantic and we had to make an emergency landing in Canada and were forced to sit on the plane for 6 hours waiting for a new plane. I do have to say the crew was great. Missing my connection I arrived home a day late. My second flight was normal with no issues. My trip had another engine problem. This time before take-off. Instead of getting home on Friday night I had to wait until Saturday night to get home. The crews and ground staff have been great but Delta is not maintaining its planes.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,3,,1,no

Delta Air Lines,8,J Rose,3rd February 2014,BKK-NRT-BKK in Business Elite on B747. Don't fly Delta much and was impressed with the product. Seats comfortable and private whilst seated on upper deck. Cabin ambience pleasant service attentive and professional IFE above average. In general a cut above the other American carriers and significantly better than the previous Delta international business product. Only disappointment was not having Premium Lane cards for arrival in BKK. BKK can have lengthy immigration queues and all major carriers provide this 'fast track' card which is a must when arriving into BKK. I enquired about it with the crew and they were baffled and seemed to have no idea with what I was talking about as if they had never heard of it. Other than that very nice experience.,,,Business Class,,,5,4,4,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,2,Bastien Antoine,31st January 2014,January 15th SLC to CDG. I would have purchased an economy comfort seat for the extra $210 but the only available ones were by the toilets. My economy seat was the most uncomfortable seat I have experienced on a long flight - inadequate seat padding and very limited recline. Otherwise the flight was acceptable the food edible the FAs competent performance on time. Next time I fly to Europe I'll avoid Delta on account of my experience with the uncomfortable seat. Based on my experience on this trip I would not recommend Delta to friends and family. I may fly Delta again but only on short domestic trips.,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,2,4,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,7,Brian Robinson,29th January 2014,"GSO-BKK and return via ATL and NRT. All flights on time and no issues with check in and boarding. All the long distance flights were on 747-400. Although you can no longer call these the ""Queen of the Sky"" they still give a comfortable reassuring ride. Delta can be complimented on upgrading their business class product. The fully flat bet is good. The duvet pillows amenity kit (no pyjamas!) and IFE are all excellent though the noise cancelling headset had connection issues on all flights. To compete with the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers though Delta needs to brush up on a few areas. In particular the menu selections and service need to be better but my biggest gripe is with the bathrooms which fully reflect the 25 year age of the plane and at the end of a 13 hour flight. I shall say no more.",,,Business Class,,,4,4,4,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,Quek Keng Guan,25th January 2014,SIN-NRT return. DL 622 and DL 621. Both flights were on 777-200ER equipped with on demand ptv. SIN-NRT: Could not find the USB port to charge my phones on the flight to NRT. Hot breakfast was served at local time 8 am 2hrs into the flight. Hot snack of chicken wrap was served 2 hrs before landing. The odd part was the entertainment programmes were switched off 4 hrs into the flight with no explanation. Most passengers were asleep due to the early departure of the flight at 5.45 am. NRT-SIN: USB port was installed beside the PTV. Hot dinner was served 2 hrs into the flight. Snack of ice cream were served 2 hrs before landing. Crew of Chinese national and Singaporean crew were helpful. Asked if passengers wanted extra ice cream. Self help galley provided Evian water only. DL offers the cheapest fare for direct flights to Japan and will travel with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,Michael Martin,20th January 2014,While the flight attendants on all the Delta flights were nice I've noticed the planes they use aren't the best of quality/maybe not well maintained and their customer service seems non-existent. On a flight I took recently from Moscow to NYC during both take off and landing the roof of the plane was leaking a lot of water (over passengers). If you were sitting in a window seat (like me) it seemed to leak quite a lot enough to get you wet. The leaking eventually stopped when the plane was higher up in the air. The flight attendants couldn't really do anything about it since it was an issue with the plane itself. I left bad feedback on the flight and filed a complaint and Delta never seems to respond. So next time I fly I will probably read more reviews on air carriers and try to pick one that's known for better service.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,3,2,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,7,S Gupta,20th January 2014,ATL-LAS December 2013. Main and pretty much only issue was legroom. In certain configurations of their 757-200 seats 2C/D are bulkhead seats where we were seated and legroom is severely restricted. Other than that it was a pretty average/decent experience. A snack basket containing the typical peanuts pretzels and chocolates was passed around twice. Flight attendants were courteous. The seat had a good amount of width and AC power outlets were available underneath. PTVs were also available with an excellent selection of holiday and other films. Since the flight departed around 9:30pm no complimentary dinner was served. All in all it was an OK flight just beware of the first class bulkhead seats on certain 757 configurations.,,,First Class,,,2,4,4,5,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,T Emmett,16th January 2014,Flew on December 19 DEN-ATL-SRQ and return all flights were on time even with all the delays in the NE. One flight had PTV's on a 757 which was very nice other 3 flights on a md's nicely updated with power outlets in economy comfort which was very nice. Greeted nicely at each gate by name.

Delta Air Lines,8,J Hutchinson,15th January 2014,Flew LHR-CUN (via ATL outbound and MSP return) in Business Elite. Pre-flight customer service (via Twitter) was excellent with the one or two queries we had. Check-in fast track security and lounge at LHR T4 very good - much better than BA at T5. Seats (flat beds) very good although foot area a little compact - we're 5'6 and 5'8 so taller travellers may be less happy. Pillow and duvet very comfortable. Food needs more investment - not terrible but not brilliant. In flight entertainment terrific but both our screens skipped and jumped on both legs (we were generously and quickly compensated for this post flight - excellent). Lack of lounge at CUN a bit disappointing on the return. We encountered many Delta staff on the journey - all are a cut above most airlines for the personal human touches. They genuinely engage. On board service excellent and friendly - on the outbound flight two crew (including the purser) came round with chocolates and thanked us for flying Delta they really sounded like they meant it. Will definitely fly Delta transatlantic again.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,3,2,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,5,C Scott,15th January 2014,DL1954 on 12/30 and DL1910 on 1/1/14. Checking in with first class with Delta was nice because we got advanced security clearance. The rest was disappointing. I guess I am used to first class with American. Snacks offered were like sombody's left over Halloween treats. There was no music or entertainment offered.,,,First Class,,,4,3,1,1,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,7,Michael Decker,14th January 2014,Flew from JFK to Las Vegas January 9-12. Check-in was very good even at 6am. I liked the bistro in the waiting area. The plane was clean and orderly. The only real disappointment was the food and drink selection offered with the flight a tablespoon of peanuts or a shy dozen of mini-pretzels. The real disappointment (inflight) was with the entertainment as in none. The screen was jumping (and audio) as if the VCR was old and the screens had rainbow colors to them as if the TV's were well past their prime. Ok no problem I'll listen the music channels nothing not one channel other than the one tied into the screen. I was told by the flight attendant that they no longer offer it. For $600+ a seat it should be a lot better especially since last year was a banner year for profits for the airlines. How sad. This is America's best? Hey Delta pay it forward and invest in your equipment.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,1,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,,M Thompson,14th January 2014,Used Delta from JFK to Fort Lauderdale and have to say that the experience was far from first class. Before takeoff a lady got on in a dishevelled state and distributed bottled water after she had stowed her luggage in an overhead locker. It turned out she was an off duty stewardess helping out the on duty staff. During the flight drinks were served and a banana was thrown to the first class passengers by way of food. The only good thing to be said was that the flight was on time.,,,First Class,,,3,2,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,Radha Manickam,13th January 2014,My husband and 1 year old daughter was flying today (01/11/2014) from Charlotte to Albany through Detroit. Their flight got delayed 1 hr due to some mechanical repairs. Then they missed their connecting flight to Albany due to that delay. They ended up waiting from 12 Noon to 8pm for their next flight to Albany. By 8pm their flight got cancelled and got a new schedule for tomorrow. With connecting flight from Detroit-Atlanta-Albany. I don't know what is going to happen tomorrow. This type of incident happens for us for the third time. Very bad service of flights.,,,Economy Class,,,,,4,3,,,no
Delta Air Lines,9,Louis Ho Nguyen,9th January 2014,SIN-NRT-SIN. Economy. Delta may fail to meet expectation of many people who fly within the States but for international flight I find they do pretty well. The flight for both legs was on time and actually arrived 30 minutes earlier than scheduled. I love their B777-200LR. I understand that Delta is an American airline so the seat was designed for a typical Caucasian. Thus the seat appears bigger and gave me more than enough space for the size of a typical Asian without upgrading my ticket. Meals were nice with various choice of beverage. There were a lot of choices for IFE from movies to music. Flight attendants were quite nice and helpful. The only minus point probably is long process of check-in at Changi (my bags were checked 3 times before boarding) which I understand due to fear of terror on flights to the US. Overall it was still a good experience especially the first time with Delta. I would definitely fly with them again for my trip to the USA some time in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,4,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,Aaron Gimmeson,9th January 2014,Flying round trip from Columbus OH to Las Vegas through Detroit. Jan 3-6 2014. Delta gate agents are rude and abrupt. They were late getting me to my connection in DTW due to computer problems during boarding at the gate in Columbus. I made it to the gate in DTW 12 min before departure but the agent had given away my seat and said sternly that it was to late and to go complain at gate A43. I did and they told me to call customer service. I did that and they said they cant do anything because I need to talk to a gate agent. They gave me the run around and really did not care. Flying home was more mechanical problems. I wound up having to sleep in DTW airport. No hotels available. When I boarded flight DL6121 the agent was slow. I fly for work and will no longer fly Delta. The ground crew and flight crew were all great and concerned for the safety of the passengers. The gate agents lack any general concern for customers safety comfort or well being.,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,4,1,,,no
Delta Air Lines,10,Kian Ti Yu,8th January 2014,Flew from LAX to Haneda (12/22/2013) and from Narita to LAX (12/29/2013). Flights were on time in fact earlier than scheduled. Flight attendants were very courteous not typical of attendants of United States airlines. The online check in and baggage drop center that takes baggage more than 3 hours before flight time make travel a breeze.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,5,Nieves Guerrero,8th January 2014,I flew during the chaos caused by the weather the delays wer understandable. Leaving mass the staff at Logan assisted me with my sick child by being attentive and making us as comfortable as they could. When we stopped in JFK again the staff were very pleasant while we waited 3 hours to board to Dominican Rep. Staff did what they could to keep passengers entertained. On the other hand I feel like customer service stops in the US while in the Dominican Rep I felt like I was dealing with a whole different airline. staff were rude and inconsiderate. Delta needs to take time to train their Dominican staff.,,,First Class,,,5,4,4,4,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,3,P Srikantaiah,7th January 2014,"I was on this flight which was delayed by over 2 hours in Atlanta and never once were we given the reason for the delay. That's fine. A delay is a delay. Here is where it gets interesting. Once we boarded this old DC plane the cabin crew promptly made an announcement that they had ""forgotten"" to load water to the tanks. So even though the flush would work there would be no water from the faucets to wash our hands. Instead there was just a bottle of water kept in the toilet. Yes that was my Delta experience! I met another traveler in Mexico a few days later who apparently flew the same flight two days later and had the same water issue. This really explains why I should avoid Delta in the future! Absolutely no customer service.",,,Economy Class,,,3,3,2,2,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,10,Loel De Leon,6th January 2014,Economy Comfort Manila to Tokyo Narita. The extra $39 is well worth it. Much more peaceful cabin and priority boarding. The extra recline and seat pitch really made a difference. Flight attendants anticipated the needs of passengers. consistently offering snacks and refreshments. they were very courteous and tried to address the concerns of passengers as best they can. I also appreciated the fact that they took the extra effort of addressing me by my name. It was very thoughtful of them.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,R Witt,4th January 2014,DL0117 on 12/29/13 STR to ATL on 767-300ER. 1x2x1 config in Delta's premium cabin remains unbeatable service levels w/Delta generally consistent. This flight even surprised on the upside: excellent menu out of STR and a top notch cabin crew. Is it a throw back to times past when an attendant cares to monitor your Scotch remains 'easy ice' i.e. bring an additional ice cube when needed and without being prodded? That was a crew that made it a joy to fly over the Holidays. Delta wins on many levels these days.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,4,S Defelice,3rd January 2014,New Orleans to Boston. A blizzard was headed for the Boston area and delays were expected. Was charged $100 because my luggage was 2.3 lbs over weight. I asked a man working at the ticket area to help me transfer to an earlier flight in order to beat the storm. He told me he would put me on standby and directed me toward a gate. Lady at the gate told me I'd have to wait an hour till she could answer any of my questions. Went back to the desk an hour later and told that the man at the check in desk must have made a mistake and that I had not been put on standby. Lady then put me in standby and told me she would call my name if a seat opened up. Everyone began to board the flight and my name had not been called just as they were closing the gate the lady yelled at me to get on the plane. Ran down the ramp. Flight staff were OK landed a little early. Things went much smoother in Atlanta.,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,3,,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,1,T Barrett,2nd January 2014,"Florida to Seattle flights delayed due to weather and would miss connection in Atlanta. Understandable. Ticket agent wanted to send me to Atlanta and sit on standby. Whereby I was not guaranteed a seat and no hotel meal compensation. Had agent book me on flight early next day instead. Booked seat from Florida to Atlanta but no seat booked from Atlanta to Seattle by agent and now on standby. Tried to assign seat over internet but was blocked because agent put me on standby. Called Delta and was informed that the airport agents now had control and could not book a seat. Told telephone agent to let me speak to supervisor as I was looking at 25 empty seats on their website. Agent spoke to supervisor and supervisor assigned me a seat. Now why couldn't other agent have done that hours earlier? Arrived at baggage check-on area (already had boarding passes) for ""red-eye"" return trip from Seattle. Stood in line watching understaffed agents for 20 minutes and was told when we finally got to the front of the line that we had missed the baggage check-in window by 3 minutes. Keep in mind we had already stood in line 20 minutes. Told to go to the Special Services line. Got in Special Services line and stood for 15 minutes. By now not only had my wife and I missed checking our bags but we had now missed the flight. Told by ""red coated"" Supervisor is that all they could do was put us on standby for a 11.25 pm ""red-eye"" flight with no guarantee we could even get on the plane as there were no seats available. As we pointed out how long we stood in their lines the ""red coat"" got surly and told us that this was our only choice. She would not help us with a room or meals. We asked about a trip the next day which she booked us on that left at 11.45 am. Now 13 hours later. When we asked where we could find a hotel she pointed the directions to the hotel board center and basically said we were on our own. The last straw was they lost our baggage on the return flight. Finally came in on the next flight after midnight next day.",,,Premium Economy,,,1,1,3,3,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,3,John Heinz,30th December 2013,2 hours flight between Atlanta and Nassau. Business class ticket. Very old and noisy aircraft (MD88). Business class seats OK. Sky Priority boarding. Except bananas and bretzel and drinks do not expect any meal served at dinner time even for a 1500 USD ticket. No lounge access for this international destination except if you have the right frequent flyer status. I will avoid to fly them again for this amount of money.,,,Business Class,,,4,4,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,Claudia Paz,29th December 2013,We made reservations way in advance prepaid our flights and chose the seats that best accommodated our needs. Delta then changed the flights on several occasions and reassigned our seats giving us the worst possible seating even having our kids separate from us. We called customer service and were told they could not do anything that they are not allowed to change other people's seats. That is exactly what they did to us! We learned our lesson the hard way and we hope to never have to fly Delta again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,10,Franki Griffith,29th December 2013,I recently took a trip from Huntsville AL to OKC from Nov 21-Dec 27th. I found my first flight to be a very pleasant experience but what impressed me was how my return flight was handled. We were late I was due to depart at 3.30 and by the time I checked in it was 3.21.

Delta Air Lines,3,T Taylor,25th December 2013,To Las Vegas from Jacksonville Florida. The plane we were on from Atlanta to Las Vegas a long flight had no leg room and there were two large men and me in a row! On the way back from Las Vegas we knew right away that our flight was going to miss the connection. I called Delta to try to get a connecting flight worked out and was on hold for around 45 minutes. Never did get it worked out over the phone. When we arrived in Atlanta they told us to go to a kiosk to find out what they had decided to do with us and a series of coupons came out. One for 25.00 of food (everything was closed) and a coupon for a hotel. On the flight back at 8 that morning the plane was packed and it looked like most had had the same kind of night we had. There were three stewardesses in the back of the plane talking so loud it kept waking everyone up. They did not provide a beverage service because of turbulence so they were non stop until I pushed my button and told them they were disturbing everyone. The girl was very rude and we heard her tell the other two we are talking too loud for the wonderful passengers out there! And went right back to their discussion.,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,2,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,8,G Garrison,23rd December 2013,BOS-AMS-BOS Dec 2013. I don't know when they put the upgraded Airbus 330s into service but it's as good as any business service I've seen on a US carrier. 1-2-1 seating so if you're by the window you're not trapped if the person next to you is in full recline mode. In the usual 2-2-2 format I've always avoided the window but on this service the window seat at 9J worked very well. The seats are on the narrow side for business but you get an individual pod that's narrower in the front (where your feet go) wider in the back; the seats have full recline. Cabin staff on both flights were senior attentive and friendly. On AMS-BOS the genial captain came back before take-off to chat up everyone in business individually. I only used the A/V to track flight progress but the screen is large and pops out of the pod wall. The pillow was comfortable. The amenities kit is about average - the usual socks etc. but nothing special and they don't offer the business amenity that my wife really likes - PJ''s.,,,Business Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,5,Farouk Mogheth,23rd December 2013,"A combination of hit and miss but as its my first ""experience"" on a US airline and using the 3 major American legacy carriers Delta seems to have offered the most consistent service level even definitely seriously sub par compared to Asian and European carriers. Flew from Bangkok to Los Angeles through Tokyo Narita. Delta's service in Thailand and Japan far superior than on US soil. BKK-NRT with a B747 the seats were extremely thin. Cannot conceive sitting in such a seat all the way to LAX. From Tokyo Narita a comfortable B777. Flights on time entertainment acceptable with an OK selection of films. Food edible however spartan portions. Flew Delta Connection from Los Angeles to San Francisco with a very comfortable Embraer jet. Not happy about paying for checked in luggage. No other service on board. The return flight was a disappointment. Delta sold me a return routing from Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda and then 19 hours later from Tokyo Narita to Bangkok which I accepted assuming that the airline will assist in the transfer and accommodation. Delta refused to assist in any of the above thus I had to handle my own transfer between the airports as well for own accommodation and food. This is the main reason why I will be adamant in flying to the USA with a non local airline so only on European Asian or Middle Eastern airlines that would offer generally a far higher service levels. The ""comfort plus"" product is a laughable one from Delta. Trying to sell seats with better leg room however seats scattered in the cabin with no better seats dedicated cabin or special menu. So not recommending this wanna-be premium economy. On board staff did their job but surprised of how detached they were from the passengers. Recommended airline but there are a lot of other better options in my experience.",,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,4,,2,yes
Delta Air Lines,,Rebecca Brown,23rd December 2013,"Newark to LA via Minneapolis. I arrived at Newark airport with plenty of time before my flight was due to leave. I was then told via the computer alert system that my flight was one hour delayed. After a one hour delay I was allowed to board the flight. We then proceed to sit on the runway for another hour and as a consequence I missed my connection. Once I landed in Minneapolis I was told (very abruptly and rudely) that I had missed the flight and was told to then search for my new boarding pass in amongst a sea of boarding passes of others who had also missed their flights because handing them out individually would have been too easy and maybe make sense? I then proceeded through the airport to the baggage reclaim and customer information area where I asked the Delta airlines representative whether there was any available food for people who had missed their flights. She told me that if I wanted something to eat I had to order a pizza. Last but not certainly not least when I was finally able to pick up my rucksack from the Delta ""office"" I was wearing a sling due to a shoulder injury. Delta staff in the office watched me struggle to pick up my backpack for around ten minutes before finally I actually had to ask them for help. I must say though through all my complaining I had two okay stewardesses on that flight however the rest of the Delta staff were rude and inconsiderate.",,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,2,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,8,J Gardner,20th December 2013,"DAL 417 LAX to SYD and DAL 16 from SYD to LAX. Both legs on Delta's 777-200LR in seat 7A. Used kiosk for check-in at both LAX and SYD. The Delta ""business class"" lounge at LAX is nothing more than Delta's normal ""Sky Club"" the facility was overcrowded and like being inside an extremely loud bar. The flights pushed back pretty much on time. Delta's 777-200LR is getting a bit worn looking and the herringbone ""suites"" that face away from the windows (as opposed to the much-better window-facing suites used by carriers like Cathay Pacific) had walls so low that privacy was minimal. I was lucky enough to have seat 7A on both flights; 7A has the advantage of having a closet next to the seat which in effect forms a cave that the seat reclines back into. The set-up is very good for allowing sleep. The flight crews were LA-based both directions seemed to be made up of senior FA's and on balance did a really nice service both directions. The flights featured three meal services - dinner/lunch a mid-flight snack and a light breakfast. The forward and mid galleys had a variety of low end snacks available throughout the flight. The AVOD system is OK (screen sizer and location) but nothing special but it does have available a fairly broad selection of movies. The best part of the flights was my ability to sleep. I am a large guy and I've had real trouble trying to sleep in the flat-bed first and business seats used by British Air Cathay Pacific and Qantas. Delta was a refreshing change. I got 7-8 solid hours of quality sleep time on both flights. Part of the reason is that the FA's move the meal service process along efficiently and get the cabin lights down early into the flight. On arrival although Delta offers BusinessElite passengers a fast-track immigration/customs pass I didn't use them because as a TSA Global Entry cardholder I was able to use the kiosks in both Sydney and LAX. As I only had carryons the total time from plane until I was out of the airport could not have been more than 10 minutes. In the past I've normally flown on Qantas to/from Australia and New Zealand but with Delta's codeshare arrangement with Virgin Australia (an excellent carrier by the way in all respects) and given my outstanding recent experience on Delta's 777 I plan to continue using Delta for my travel to/from Oceania.",,,Business Class,,,4,5,3,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,R Rodriguez,20th December 2013,"MNL-NRT-JFK (B744/Premium Economy) EWR-ATL(A319/Y) ATL-SNA (B757/Y) SNA-MSP (A319/Y) MSP-EWR (A320/Y) and JFK- NRT-MNL (B744/Y). In general all my flights departed on schedule and on certain occasions even arrived at my destination ahead of schedule. I can safely say that since the last time I flew DL about 2 years ago I noticed a significant improvement in the quality of service. Overall flying experience was very pleasant. Although a lot of the cabin crew are senior I found most to be a lot nicer compared to the grumpy ones in the past. One noticeable improvement was upon boarding. The boarding gate staff are all friendly with special mention to the ones in ATL and JFK T4. They make it a point to greet all passengers by name and with genuine smiles. I was quite impressed by the staff at JFK T4 who took extra time to guide me through the check-in process using the kiosks. They were very helpful and not in a rushed manner. In-flight food on the long-haul flights were decent enough. For the short-haul flights I was able to have as much nuts and pretzels as I want. IFE was pretty good with and easy interface and lots of options to choose from. I thought of trying the premium economy seats and though I'm 6'0"" tall and a little on the heavy side I still didn't find it of much value considering the add-on fee. I really didn't feel much of a difference compared to regular Y. I also found the new seats to be slightly more comfortable and didn't feel as cramped as before. Moreover I've been lucky enough to have entire rows of 3 to myself on most of the flights I took particularly the long-haul ones. It took a bit work checking seat assignments on a regular basis but the effort was well worth. Not only did I get a whole lot of extra space and privacy but extra TV monitors pillow and blankets as well. Much much better than premium economy but at no extra cost. It was an overall pleasant experience flying DL this time.",,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,4,,4,yes

Delta Air Lines,,S Sherry,17th December 2013,We left unreasonably early (6 hours ahead) to drop off our rental car and to accommodate the weather. While on route to the airport Delta left a voicemail that our flight was delayed so we would miss our next flight home. He looked up another potential flight and asked if we were able to make it to a flight that should have been boarding as we spoke. So it seemed unlikely that we would make it but it was delayed. So we rush to get to that flight make it to our next stop and are now hours early for our next flight. We head over to Delta and ask if there is any way possible to leave on an earlier flight home because it was not in our plan to be so early and sit at an airport for 5 hours. They could not accommodate us for an inconvenience that was not our fault without an extra charge of one hundred dollars.

Delta Air Lines,10,J Katnic,16th December 2013,I had to make a last minute trip (same day round-trip) to SFO from LAX on 12/12/2013. I have not flown in economy in years except for Southwest but chose Delta as their price was much lower than Southwest (first class not worth it for this short of flight in my opinion): I booked this trip 10 days in advance. While these flights are branded as Delta they are operated by Compass. I must say that this is an excellent product! My flight to SFO which left at 7.00am left on time and arrived early. In addition a light breakfast snack was served. This flight was half full so I asked for and was given an extra snack to take with me. This kind gesture saved me from having to purchase lunch later. The flight back left SFO at 5.00pm and arrived back on time. This flight was full but the same professional service was received. That being said a snack and drink service helped make a really long day end well. These flights are operated by EMB 175 planes and there are no middle seats only window or aisle. Besides the great price service and on time performance I would recommend this trip as there are assigned seats and clearing security at the Delta terminals in LAX and SFO is much quicker than the Southwest terminals at each airport. I still love Southwest but on this route I have now found a better airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,5,yes

Delta Air Lines,7,Mike Davies,16th December 2013,Outward Manchester UK to Miami via Atlanta 5/12/13 and return from Fort Lauderdale 12/12/13. Flight booked in May for a 13/12 return. One month after booking the return ATL-MAN was cancelled by Delta. Automatically rebooked on a flight for the following day. Delta refused point blank to compensate for the inconvenience and extra nights accommodation. As such we chose to fly back a day earlier then our original plans. My request for compensation was a free upgrade from economy to economy plus on the return Atlantic flight. Simply had the terms and conditions quoted to me. Online check in is a joke. Had seats allocated together on each flight but on clicking the change seat option you will find all other seats marked as unavailable. Options were available to upgrade however at a cost. Our expectations for the flight were therefore low on boarding. However both pleasantly surprised with the flight and service. Transatlantic flight on a B767-300 which featured personal seat back TVs. Good choice although the music channels were a little mainstream for my preference. Food more than OK. Plenty of soft drinks offered and alcohol with the main meal. The return flight was on an older model and featured overhead TVs which didn't matter too much as it was an overnight flight and a good hour shorter in travel time than outward. Both internal flights on a B757-200 were adequate. Seat pitch for all four flights was fine typical of an economy flight. Professional cabin crew on all sectors flown. Touch of humour with the Christmas 2013 flight safety video - certainly kept you watching it. All four flights were full in all cabins all had on time departures and arrivals. Apart from the attitude towards a cancelled flight no issues at all with Delta and would certainly fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,4,,3,yes

Pretty good for 2 hour flight although no IFE. As it was thanksgiving I expected the worst but flight took off on time and landed early. On the return all 3 managed to get upgraded to first. Again pretty good for Thanksgiving Sunday. Landed on time bags already on belt by the time we hauled ourselves from E terminal to bag claim.

Delta Air Lines,8,D TenClay,10th December 2013,MSP-JFK-MXP and return 4 days later. Economy comfort. First time doing this route as I prefer going into and out of Linate - Milan but short notice trip forced itinerary. Very surprised and pleased with the 767 leg (JFK- Milan) wider seats and quieter cabin than the A330's used on MSP-AMS. CRJ 9XX on the way out a bit small for a 2.5 hr flight A319 on return bigger but noisy. JFK transfer a bit of a hassle with on-going construction but new terminal is nice improvement. MXP was a pain to exit on return. Overall Delta experience is improving and remains a decent choice from MSP to Europe. I still prefer Linate over Malpensa at least for now.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,4,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,Leo Enticknap,9th December 2013,ONT-SLC-CDG-AMS-MME on 2-3 December (some of the flights were on AF and KL metal but it was a Delta ticket with DL flight numbers for all the segments). An unremarkable and hassle-free journey: all flights were on time the vegan meal I requested for the transatlantic leg was there and both I and my suitcase made it successfully through three quite tight connections (though if I hadn't been able to use the Priority lane at CDG as a result of being a Flying Blue gold I don't think I'd have made that one). Delta's refurbished 767-300ERs are a vast improvement on the previous cabin - they're now even nicer than the ex-Northwest A330s. The legroom in economy comfort is such that at 201cm tall I didn't feel cramped at all and the reading light actually lets you read without eyestrain. My only beef here is that the IFE was virtually unviewable because of the constant stream of PA announcements throughout the flight that kept pausing it. After an hour of trying to watch a movie I'd only seen about 20 minutes of actual footage and when someone came on the PA yet again to tell me in French that Delta extends a special welcome to Skyteam partners etc. I gave up and read a book.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,2,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,L Michael,6th December 2013,I started flying Delta about a year ago and surprisingly there wasn't much to complain about. After reading a few reviews I was a bit sceptical but I flew them from SIN-NRT-JFK and I enjoyed the flight more than SQ. The flight attendants were warmer and friendly while we departed on time and on schedule without delays. The legroom was better than SQ and was worth the extra cost. The food although small in portions was not as bad as I expected. Overall I would recommend flying Delta.,,,Premium Economy,,,4,4,3,5,,5,yes

Catering was adequate for a 2-hour flight although the meal uploaded in Atlanta was of better quality than the one served on the return. Return flight was delayed by 1.5 hours due to mechanical issues but the crew handled it well and tried to assist passengers with connections.

Delta Air Lines,7,T Matava,3rd December 2013,DL 80/81 ATL-BRU-ATL. Spent a lot of money to fly in Business Elite. Seats comfortable (lay flat) and entertainment system has an amazing selection of options. Food however was so salty and so processed that it was pretty much inedible. Crews on both flights were quite senior and offered good levels of service being most accommodating. However they all lacked a sense of warmth and welcoming. I am a big fan of Delta Air Lines but these flights were somewhat disappointing primarily due to the poor quality of food and beverage provided in both directions.,,,Business Class,,,4,4,1,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,6,Jeannelle Zantman,2nd December 2013,Everything was fine however My fiancé and I booked together and were seated separately and they wouldn't do anything to try to get us to be close this is something that many people had complaints and passengers would switch seats to be with their loved ones. They also made us check a bag. Very unhappy about having to check that bag (which was smaller than the other bags that made it on and persons that got on after us also didn't have to check their bags). I don't recommend traveling with them. I just wish that they would have sat us next to each other it makes no sense that they didn't.,,,Economy Class,,,2,5,4,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,,J Phan,2nd December 2013,"It's been about a month now since my trip from Milan Italy to Las Vegas NV. I flew from Milan to JFK (New York). We waited 4 hours for our connecting flight from New York to Las Vegas. I was assigned a boarding pass and a seat number (24C & 24D) at Terminal 4 gate B25. When I arrived to board the plane at the gate the rudest workers at Delta claimed they didn't see me on the system. When I ask how could this be the Delta representative kept saying ""I don't know"" very condescendingly. An hour before they announced that they needed 2 volunteers to stay overnight for a next flight because they overbooked. Delta forced us to stay at JFK while letting 2 other people take our seats on the flight that we booked over a month prior. We flew all the way from Milan to JFK how were they unable to see us on the system? How were we able to get the boarding passes in the first place if we weren't in the system? The people at the service desk kept giving us attitude and saying to us that they don't see our names on the system. I was so disappointed with my flight experience.",,,Economy Class,,,3,1,4,3,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,I Warren,2nd December 2013,I booked our Delta flight in May 2013 for 5 family members going to Jamaica Saturday Nov. 23 and returning Saturday Nov.30. We had three changes to our itinerary the last one was in Oct. The flight from Atlanta to Montego Bay was awful. We set in the very back 2 rows of the plane not together but in 2 different rows. We had no windows. On the way back it was the same way. We had our 6 year old granddaughter with us that could see nothing on her first time flying. I'm a Gold SkyMiles Member.,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,7,B Walberer,29th November 2013,SFO-ATL-LIM return in regular economy. I got a great deal from SFO to LIM. My overall experience was good. Service on the domestic legs was better than expected with friendly crews and regular drink runs. The crew also responded to the flight attendant button rather promptly. The weak point was the flight from ATL to LIM which was an older plane without personal IFE. However the LIM-ATL flight was on a more modern plane with IFE and plenty of movie choices all free of charge. Food was ok not great but edible and of sufficient quantity. No free alcohol even on international flights to/from LIM. Transfer in ATL was easy with airline representatives at the gate to assist passengers in the transfer process. Would recommend especially if one can get a good deal.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,D White,29th November 2013,I traveled from Charlotte NC to Milwaukee WI and my connection in Detroit was a bit late and there was not time to transfer my suitcases. They did not arrive in baggage claim. But they delivered them 2 hours away in Madison WI on the same day and it was Thanksgiving Day.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,P Fahy,29th November 2013,Flew to New York from Dublin with 2 small kids Fri 22 Nov and returned Mon 25. I must say I was very impressed. The cabin crew were pleasant and professional. The plane was full and they were kept busy but they really made my daughters feel special giving them extra cookies drinks passing chat etc. Even when one woman decided to go to the restroom a few seconds before takeoff - a potentially serious situation - they were firm but polite as they leaped down the aisle to make her sit down. IFE worked on all seats and while a couple of inches of extra legroom wouldn't have gone amiss it was fine for a six hour flight. A word about the meals. I've noticed many times that the catering supplied by European companies (ie going out) is far superior to what you get coming back from the USA regardless of airline. But that's the only criticism really. Well done Delta. In my experience you're at least as good as BA KLM and Virgin.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,Craig Saunders,28th November 2013,We flew from Manchester UK to Tampa and as Delta gold members we were upgraded to business and first class due to coach being full. It was a great flight great crew and food 3 days later flew from Tampa to Texas Hobby via ATL in coach. The flights were again great snacks and drinks really good service. I feel if you are nice with their staff they are nice back.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,B Ayter,27th November 2013,"I booked a first class ticket using miles about a month ago. The only reason I booked the particular flight (red eye) was because of the 1st class seat options. At that time there were a considerable number of 1st class seats open. I checked in via mobile 24 hours before-no issues. Got through security-still no issues. When I went to board the plane I was told when they scanned my boarding pass that I'd been downgraded to Economy (not even Economy Comfort) because I was on a complimentary upgrade. I explained that absolutely was not the case and that I'd specifically booked the flight as a 1st class ticket. The response I received at that point was that ""Corporate did it because of an equipment change we don't know the criteria they used and we can't change it."" I took it up to the most senior person I could at the gate and got the same generic answer. I used to be a huge proponent of Delta and have defended them countless times to friends. I will never fly with them again.",,,Economy Class,,,1,3,2,3,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,5,A Arriens,20th November 2013,Good on time performance. Wished to have a second warm meal on board an intercontinental flight then just a breakfast. Very noisy cabin due insulation on the 737. Crew seemed unorganized and hasty. IFE wasn't working properly.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,2,2,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,8,P Loguda,20th November 2013,Early November BE flight JFK-CDG. Clean aircraft competent FA adequate catering but the Delta lounge at T4 is a disgrace. The complimentary wines are not listed anywhere while the charged offerings are both printed and on electronic pads. Salty snacks only or purchase food. Have they visited their partner Virgin Atlantic's BC lounge? On time arrival and good baggage delivery. Very limited movies on this flight.,,,Business Class,,,4,4,4,2,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,P Loguda,20th November 2013,On time departure despite chaotic boarding in BE due to a seat configuration change. FA were quite senior and not well groomed especially the purser whose uniform was stained. The FA's were very active with service however. Catering good especially the pre arrival hamburger. Lots of videos although every time there was an announcement (and they seem to make many) my movie reverted to the French language. (CDG-EWR). Pre departure lounge was Air France which was offering a buffet lunch along with many wines champagne and snacks.,,,Business Class,,,3,4,5,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,1,Julian Leese,20th November 2013,My wife and I flew back to London Heathrow on flight 19 from Detroit. This airline is a disgrace. Very poor food but it was the service from the flight attendants which was particularly bad. They seem to have absolutely no idea of offering a service. Passengers were treated with complete indifference and staff spent most of their time in the galley eating and talking loudly. Never again. Next time I go to Detroit I will fly BA or virgin to NY so that I only need to suffer the short hop from NYC to Detroit. Coincidentally I have a friend who has just taken a flight on Delta from NY to London who also experienced shocking service.,,,Premium Economy,,,1,1,2,1,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,,Destiny Yildirim,20th November 2013,I have been flying and traveling internationally for over 10 years and after flying Delta for the first time I will not be traveling for a very long time. Aside from the cramped plane I was refused food service on my 13 hour flight by the extremely rude flight attendants until I gave in and purchased food items. The flight itself was the absolute worst 6.5 hours of turbulence triggered my anxiety and when I tried to get my medicine from overhead I was shouted at by the attendants. Deltas entertainment was terrible and needs to be updated there were 2 small TVs in front of easily over 50 people. When the flight was over there was a half hour delay and I had to catch my next connecting flight. I will never fly Delta again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,D Wee,15th November 2013,My 7 month pregnant wife and I flew from Chicago to Mexico on Nov 7 2013 on Delta flight 8048. According to the Delta representative I spoke with on the phone Delta messed up and rescheduled everyone on this flight to Nov 8 (without telling anyone and even though the Nov 7 flight still flew). When we didn't show up for our Nov 8 flight in Chicago (since we were already in Mexico since Nov 7 and never knew about the Nov 8 flight) our return flight on Nov 10 was cancelled. We arrived to our airport in Mexico on Nov 10 to find out we had no return ticket to Chicago. The Delta representative was so sorry that she gave us a single 25 dollar gift card to split amongst the 2 of us. This is ridiculous. Why should I ever fly Delta ever again?,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,6,Fred C Brunetti,15th November 2013,I flew from Chicago to Atlanta. The plane was full the staff very nice and friendly. My only complaint: the cabin was filthy it needed attention and the seats were small I'm a big guy 6 ft and 220 lbs. The flight was a short one if it had been longer it would have been uncomfortable.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,1,M Forsyth,13th November 2013,Worst airline to fly on if you are in the military traveling on orders. First who in the military travels with one bag that's right we don't we normaly have a few bags and one normaly weighs between 50 to 100 lbs. So why is it that all the other carriers let the military check one bag up to 100lbs no we are not getting over this is the bag that we transport our gear in. The gear that we use to take the fight to the enemy. Come on Delta get with the program and stop trying to make an extra buck off the military. I guess that's why the military generally uses American Airlines first and Delta only as a last resort. The flight only had a few people on board and when some of them asked if they could move to a vacant seat they were told no.,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,10,S Morgan,13th November 2013,Manchester - Atlanta - San Diego. Plenty of snacks and drinks served. Lunch was good and enjoyable. Good selection of films television and music staff were pleasant and efficient. Temperature of cabin was just right. A very positive experience.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,1,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,3,Tim Masson,10th November 2013,SEA-AMS-SEA. This last transatlantic with Delta will be my very last. I cannot believe KLM/Air France have partnered with Delta and I'm afraid I'm unlikely to continue patronising that group unless I'm sure I'm not flying on a Delta staffed plane. The service was just appalling. The seats in economy were very poor. The underseat space was cramped by some electrical equipment and also very hot as a result. The in-flight entertainment system was not functioning in my seat or any other seat in our row. The only element of the flight that was any good was the lounge in Seattle which had some space to work and attentive staff.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,3,J Lee,10th November 2013,BusinessElite SIN-NRT-HNL. Choose Delta only because it offered completely flat beds. B777-200LR flying from SIN-NRT- SIN offers ample legroom when in full recline. However the 767-300 planes NRT-HNL-NRT falls short for anyone over 6’. In full bed mode the ‘seat’ tucks into the narrow space of the seat in front of you. My main gripe was the cleanliness of the cabin. Dirtiest Business Class I've ever flown! Cabin Staff were ok not overly friendly. Pales to any Asian flight crew.,,,Business Class,,,3,2,3,3,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,3,Tana Hanlon,10th November 2013,"My Husband and I booked First Class. Our plane was finally determined as ""Delayed for Catering"" for 4 hours. We missed our connection of course. Originally we were told it was due to weather. There were no other flights to get us home according to the agent in Salt Lake City who said ""I don't have time to help you go over there to the phone bank"". With no flight no luggage and no help we paid for a hotel room had to by clothes meals and I hoped our underwear would dry I washed it in the sink for the next days flight. We had purposely reserved seats together I have a great deal of flight anxiety. Our rescheduled flights separated us and I cried most of the way home. It's not that we are any better than others but we paid a lot of money for our trip on Delta First Class. We bought the special tickets expecting special service. I'm disturbed with the airlines performance and regard for passengers. I guess we paid for only a larger seat.",,,First Class,,,5,1,5,4,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,10,N Dinno,6th November 2013,When my wife and I travel we usually travel with Delta or Alaska. We always travel first class and so cannot comment on how things are in coach however we have never been disappointed with Delta traveling first class. They always treat us well from check-in to in-flight. The planes are always clean and the staff is incredibly attentive. Unlike Alaska they never skimp on the amenities. They serve full size meals and are constantly checking to see if there is anything else they can do to accommodate you.,,,First Class,,,5,5,5,3,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,Kieren Perry,4th November 2013,I have to say that whilst everyone likes to moan about airlines my recent flight with Delta was great on their services from/to LHR-JFK. The food was also excellent on the outward flight being a vegetarian I requested a special meal and was served minted peas with wild rice and marinated tofu along with a bread roll cheese and crackers and a dessert. Then just before landing we were served Calzone. They certainly don't let you go hungry! On the return journey however the main dish was pasted and vegetables which wasn't to my liking at all but it was a late night flight and I wasn't particularly hungry anyway breakfast then consisted of a cereal bar and a banana. The only gripes I have are that the leg room is cramped - but where isn't it these days! With regard to the on board entertainment whilst having an excellent selection of content was somewhat slow and sluggish and even required re-starting on the return flight. On the ground baggage arrived promptly and check in was also efficient at both airports with staff being courteous and professional. Both flights left before the scheduled departure time and arrived well before their scheduled arrival time in both cases even though on the outward flight there was a delay in passengers boarding. For the price it was truly excellent.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,2,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,Melissa Foley,4th November 2013,Just flew from BWI to Melbourne FL. Worst flights I have ever had. Both flights were overbooked. The staff were asking for volunteers to take a later flight. The staff were confused and had no idea on what they were doing. They were rude and didn't know their jobs very well. This was both trips with connecting flights in Atlanta both ways. Never will I fly Delta again. One of the staff was standing at the desk telling customers she was nobody and couldn't help anyone. Now that is customer service from Delta Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,2,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,10,F Hintz,31st October 2013,My husband and I took a vacation back to the Midwest. We flew Delta from LAX to Minneapolis to Milwaukee with the reverse for the return flights. I was really dreading this - I have MS and knew I would be using a wheelchair. Everything was great! Flights were on time and the pilot and crew were so kind friendly and helpful. My husband and I are tall and we were pleasantly surprised to have ample leg room. Also Delta did a great job with the video on pre-flight safety notes. No one seems to listen to the actual stewards and stewardesses when it comes to this but the video had everyone's attention in this digital age. I definitely recommend flying Delta.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,4,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,S Buntain,29th October 2013,SFO to SLC and SLC to LAX in First. Old Airbus 320 on first leg. Interesting no life vests on board just the 'buoyant' seat cushion. Newish 737-800 on leg to LAX. Excellent service and attention from Hawaiian based crew best of any American airline I have traveled on. Both flights on time check in very quick and luggage appeared rapidly. Would recommend.,,,First Class,,,4,5,3,3,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,6,R Girard,28th October 2013,I flew from Toronto to Atlanta Atlanta to Cancun and Cancun to Atlanta. The seats were very comfy with a good recline especially between Atlanta and Cancun. Crew was very polite but the food choice was very poor. My flight between Toronto and Atlanta was the worst. It was operated by express jet on the behalf of Delta Airlines: poor food was served and the crew wasn't helpful at all. The seats were very hard. Definitely a bad flight. I recommend to fly with Delta airlines despite all but avoid to fly with it subsidiary express jet.,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,2,3,,3,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,Jose Gamero,28th October 2013,SFO-LAX LAX-KOA KOA-LAX LAX-SEA SEA-CDG. Very nice experience (again) with Delta. I love Delta upgrade policies on internal flights everything is clear and fair you know at any time why you have been upgraded or not. All flights on time cabin crew smiling all the time and very professional. Very nice food. Twice upgraded with my ElitePlus status. Delta Economy comfort seats really worth.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,5,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,7,Linda Theis,22nd October 2013,"On our outbound flight the crew ensured some people with ""carry on"" luggage checked their luggage prior to boarding. It appears that many of these ""carry on"" suitcases would not fit into the guide at the check in counter. Often these suitcases barely fit into the overhead. We only take on to the flight my husband's CPAP my purse his small back pack with his meds and my carry-on shoulder bag. All these items fit under the seat in front of us. On our way back people had these ""carry on"" suitcases and one woman had 2! Neither of which fit under the seat. I had a man beside me with a large backpack that he did not stow. He left it standing under his legs. As a result his foot was under the seat in front of me! Where are my feet supposed to go? He should have been told to either stow this backpack in the overhead bins if it did not fit under the seat. Then to add injury to insult I was going to put my umbrella into the overhead and was told that it may impede stowing suitcases! When the service came around I asked for a Bloody Mary mix no ice. The flight attendant complained that this would take more than half a can I don't want ice as it waters down the drink and it's cooled enough. I check all airlines to find the best price I can find. For this trip it was Delta (Alaska). But just because I may find a good price does not mean that I should be treated this way.",,,Economy Class,,,4,3,1,1,,4,yes

Delta Air Lines,2,Chris Sanchez,20th October 2013,"In my opinion Delta airline is the worst I have experienced. I am silver and this is the end of my Delta loyalty. I attempted to hop on an earlier flight several times because I had completed my work in Greensboro early. The lady eagerly said "" are you Gold or Platinum""? I said ""no I am Silver."" She stated it would be 50 dollars to go on standby but she is not going to bother because I am silver. With that I was dismissed with a ""Next"". This is not the first time this has occurred and I travel for business.

Delta Air Lines,3,Purran Alleyne,20th October 2013,Took 4 Delta flights 11/10/13 London - Minneapolis - Las Vegas 15/10/13 Las Vegas - Atlanta - London. First time experiencing flying with Delta and it was very disappointing. Like previous comments booked ticket through KLM/Air France where we have always receive a brilliant service. Wondering why they have partnered with Delta to lower their standards. Flight from London to Minneapolis ever so rude cabin crew. Nobody at the entrance to welcome the passengers and direct them to their seats. Not a single smile and very abrupt cabin crew members. The only good thing was they had a good selection of entertainment at least it kept our mind away from their rudeness. Food selection was average. Flight from Minneapolis - Las Vegas more friendly crew and drinks were offered regularly and adequately which made us really surprise for a domestic flight compared to the opposite for the international flight. On our way back at the airport in Las Vegas when checking in again not a single smile from the ground crew or any welcome. Flight from Las Vegas - Atlanta was fine and crew friendly and adequate snacks and drinks served. International flight from Atlanta - London we were welcome this time at the entrance and were directed to our seat. An unpleasant surprise was waiting for me as soon as I popped down the seat tray in front of me to read. Yes it was messy with food stain and dry sauce on it from the previous flight and has not been clean which put me off eating. I requested it to be cleaned which was done pretty much straight away but no apologies whatsoever from the cabin crew. What was more intriguing was the contrast of service between the domestic and the international flights. Will not recommend it to any friends or family.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,3,4,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,10,Boris Burshteyn,20th October 2013,Flight DL241 from Rome to Atlanta. Great flight and service from stewards. We even couldn't fill the 11 hour flight. Great attitude and always busy.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,2,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,2,T Denby,20th October 2013,Poor customer service. Sold my seat to someone who was on standby in a complete and utter shambles mix up. Had to ask people to leave the plane for compensation. Poor attitude of staff not helpful at all no empathy for customers situations. Poor service on flights entertainment not working and having to reboot seems to be a daily problem. Planes were dirty and tired. Food was average breakfast dire scrambled egg in a soggy roll after an 8 hour flight. Why not keep it simple with a croissant or pastry or muffin? Wouldn't fly again if I had the choice.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,3,2,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,,Michelle Fontelieu,16th October 2013,"My disabled husband few up to PA from Dallas. His flight up was delayed in Atlanta because the plane he was supposed to fly out on lost its navigation system and they had to find another. That was bad enough but on his way home he left Harrisburg and flew into Detroit when he got off the plane he asked for a wheelchair and help getting to the gate where his connecting flight was departing and was told ""Just go that way and turn left and you will get to the gate."" He got no help so missed his flight to DFW because he was not able to hurry. He was re- ticketed and had to fly into Atlanta before he could return to Texas. On the flight from Atlanta to DFW he was assigned a seat in the back. I was told it was my fault that my husband couldn't get a wheelchair because I didn't book his flight as a disabled passenger!

Delta Air Lines,2,Peter Courtley,15th October 2013,JFK to LHR leaving 9.10pm 12th Oct. Delta 0005. Have just returned from NY to London and can only agree with the negative reviews. The most rude cabin staff I have ever experienced. We actually got our tickets through Air France and I noticed that another partner was Virgin an airline I use frequently to go to Tokyo with and rate highly. What on Earth are these decent airlines partnering with this outfit for? Food was also terrible and complimentary drink service a joke. The public address system didn't work I see others have commented the same why can't they fix simple things like that? They must know it doesn't work the staff get angry when you ask them to repeat things. A bad end to an otherwise superb visit to the Big Apple.,,,Economy Class,,,3,,1,3,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,10,Kenneth Mize,13th October 2013,Flew Delta Connection (ExpressJet) from Gainesville Florida to Atlanta. Flight was on time and actually arrived ahead of schedule.

Delta Air Lines,10,J Kell,13th October 2013,Took 4 Delta flights over the summer Amsterdam-Boston Boston-Atlanta Atlanta-Chicago and Boston-Amsterdam on each of the flights the cabin crew were very friendly and attentive (especially the Atlanta-Chicago flight) were relaxed and seemed to enjoy their job. Seats on all flights were very comfortable and the inflight entertainment on the two international segments was very comprehensive. Plenty of legroom too. Full meal service and hot towels were provided on the international segments which was much appreciated. Domestically Free drinks and snacks were offered which is really all that was required for these flights. I will recommend Delta to my friends and family and look forward to flying with them again along with their partner KLM they offer an excellent route network.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,Jeff Wallace,10th October 2013,with a group of 86 flying DL16 and 17 SYD-LAX return Sept/Oct 2013. this is the second large group experience on this route with Delta the last being four years ago. As in the last I have nothing but praise for Delta. Check- ins with lots of excess/oversized luggage were most efficient and very quick indeed. The ground staff at both terminals were polite well trained and accommodating. The self check-in computers in LAX were very intuitive and easy to use. Both flights were on time. Inflight service was excellent. Flying the return route in the back of economy I noted how little wait there was for meals after the service had started. Again the service was not only quick but accommodating and compared very well to Singapore; my personal benchmark. The food was fine for economy class airline fare. The entertainment options were comprehensive. Perhaps the airline could upgrade its earphones a little. Seating was comfortable. The Comfort Economy which I used on the outward bound trip was well and truly worth the money. Most importantly Delta has its own terminal at LAX; meaning you avoid the general admissions hall. This is an excellent reason in itself to choose the airline on the SYD-LAX route.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,,Mary Fisher,10th October 2013,I booked a flight from Denver Colorado to Rochester NY with a connecting flight in LaGuardia. I booked the flight for my grandfathers funeral that was the next morning. The flight was delayed so I was unable to make my connecting flight. Instead they put me on a flight to Salt Lake City Utah to go to Atlanta Georgia to go to Rochester NY. It took over 20 hours to get from Denver to Rochester there was no compassion for my situation by the Delta airline staff. Horrible customer service. I will never fly Delta again.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,,G Lindegger,9th October 2013,"I regularly travel between South Africa and the USA always on South African Airways (SAA). I have just travelled on Delta from South Africa to Atlanta. Both the ground staff and cabin staff were appalling. Gives rudeness a whole new meaning. Do Delta train staff to be so rude or is this a criterion for selection to Delta staff. We were offered no headphones. After 45 mins of attempting to get the cabin crew attention we were finally given a broken set of earphones. We again had great difficulty in getting their attention in getting another set. There was no choice of wines. Just a glass of box wine. We asked for a large bottle of water as my colleague and I drink a great deal en route. We were told that this is not allowed! We were assured that cabin crew would pace the plane with offers of drinks all night. Not only was this absolutely not the case but again it was virtually possible to get their attention at any stage of the night. The supper was moderate. The ""breakfast"" was probably the worst meal I have had on a flight ever. It was accompanied by a literally frozen salad so one had to chomp the ice off. SAA offers seats in the emergency exit at no charge. Delta uses this as another opportunity to rip off customers. Delta staff do yourselves a favour and travel on SAA to find out how to offer a high lass service.",,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,4,,1,no

I took the flight to and fro from Shanghai to Tokyo. it was a nice experience. The safety presentation that they provide is really unique. Food Quality was also excellent. Staff was very polite inside the airline but Staff at Tokyo Airport Check-In counters were rude and unfriendly and I hope Delta can do something about it as it spoils the image of the airline.

Delta Air Lines,1,Adam Mueller,7th October 2013,My wife and I recently traveled for business out of 4 flights 2 of the departing flights were late the second causing us to miss our connecting flight that left early. The flight was scheduled for 12.05 and we were standing at the gate at 12.03 the plane was already gone after we rushed off the plane and across Atlanta airport because this being a Delta hub they can't have planes in the same concourse. We go to the counter and are told they moved us to a different flight without telling us because we weren't going to make our original flight. So they are delaying us 2 hours because they couldn't leave on time for a 8.25 first flight. I politely asked if we could wait in the Delta sky club and was rudely told that it costs 50.00 to use the sky club. I will make sure I will not fly Delta again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,2,no
Delta Air Lines,3,K Stephens,7th October 2013,October 6 from LAX to ATL-Flight started out fine nothing really to complain about. The stewards were average somewhat snooty. Had a good selection of entertainment. Regular snacks on the plain (peanuts pretzels cookies). The end of the flight was extremely rough due to rain but the captain gave some reassurance. Then we landed with only minutes until our next connecting flight to MGM. This is where our trip took a nasty turn. We arrived at the gate with 20 minutes to spare (our flight was to take off at 8.55) but our flight was delayed 5 minutes so we had some breathing room. Then our flight got delayed another 20 minutes then another hour then at 11.45 (sitting in the terminal for over two hours) they cancelled it. We got a rental car that we could have had two hours ago and been home by now.,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,3,5,,4,no
Delta Air Lines,9,Ivan Dzhur,6th October 2013,6 sectors with Delta in last 3 month. Winnipeg-Minneapolis-Amsterdam on July 10th Amsterdam-Minneapolis-Winnipeg on August 19th then Winnipeg-MSP-LaGuardia on August 27th. All flights except one on time great service provided by cabin crew. On long haul flights hot towels were offered which is very nice touch. Great food and beverages. Bags delivered promptly on arrival. Delta prices and customer service is definitely competitive. Will fly with them again!,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,3,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,9,M Campbell,2nd October 2013,Man to SFO via Atlanta. New York to Manchester via Atlanta. Both Manchester flights on A330 very comfortable seating is 2x4x2 with each seat having its own inflight entertainment. Other sectors on A319/b737. Service on all the flights was excellent very friendly staff. A lot better than American. Reserved seats together on all flights when booking saved a lot of problems at check in. Transfer in Atlanta was quick and efficient well within 90 minutes suggested. Flights were a good deal.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,8,G Stella,29th September 2013,AUS to JFK JFK to NCE flight DL 1972 and DL 0082. Return NCE to AMS to ATL to AUS. DL 9497 and DL0239 with ATL to AUS DL 0686. I prefer Delta when flying American carriers and they're my no. 2 choice for all airlines Air France being my no. 1. In a trip this month to France flying into Nice I would have few complaints. An issue I've not encountered before rather two issues are the problem of the midplane lavatories next to the exit row seats and Deltas food service. I'll leave it to the reader to figure the issues with the lavatories and in fairness it should be an issue for all airlines flying the 767. Food however is a real issue. I have never had worse airline food than these two trips. When a convenience store Hot Pocket rates over Delta's offerings there is a real problem.,,,Premium Economy,,,3,3,1,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,10,M Whiley,29th September 2013,LHR-JFK-LAX-LHR (via Detroit). I purchased the tickets for almost £300 cheaper then the British Airways / Virgin Atlantic equivalent - and it was money well saved! To JFK had great pitch in 767 economy great food drink and snacks and the on demand touch screen entertainment meant the flight went really quick. All the internal flights were on 757s and they were as equally as good and all had touch screen on demand entertainment which I wasn't expecting. It's right to say that American airlines have a bad reputation but my perception has changed and when I come back to the USA next year I will fly delta. The product is on par if not better then the other airlines and would recommend them.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,5,,5,yes
Delta Air Lines,5,Oyinlola Fashina,29th September 2013,I have been a gold member for at least one year. I usually fly every 4 to 6 weeks from DCA to Lagos Nigeria. The food service is extremely poor. Breakfast is disappointing I have now learnt to eat before flying. The airline assumes everyone can eat the cheesy bread served in the AM the rice has practically no taste and the bathrooms are in such a bad state before we land. I have only been upgraded twice on the economy flights. I ask each time and the response is the same 'you may or may not be upgraded and you will be told at the gate'. I flew Air France on the trip before last and even got upgraded on that flight to economy comfort. Delta really does need to appreciate their gold members. I fly delta because of convenience but I'm beginning to think it may not be worth it. Bad food with no absolutely no fringe benefits is quite frustrating especially when other airlines offer much more. To fly long distance every 4 to 6 weeks with no benefits are not worth it.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,1,4,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,1,M Heidenfelder,26th September 2013,Whatever happened to schedule integrity? We booked our vacation to St. Martin on Delta because no overnight flights were required. Then they changed their schedule and now we have to overnight in Detroit on the way home. They will do nothing about this inconvenience and expense.,,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,,3,no
Delta Air Lines,10,P Pomeranze,25th September 2013,LAX-JFK DL1762 Sep 19 JFK-SEA DL 161 Sep 22. Business elite 767. Excellent experience especially for domestic service. Truly international service with lie flat seats duvets and quite good food. Service was efficient and warm. Would definitely choose this again over most other carriers on these routes.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,5,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,2,Torracchi Sandro,25th September 2013,Seattle (SeaTac) - Paris (CDG): 23 September. Flight was horrible! Low Seat comfort and low quality food. But the worst thing is seat assignment: my girlfriend was behind me and that's how it was for a lot of couples and friends! It's obvious that this is done on purpose in order to earn money from change seat utility during the check-in online.,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,2,3,,1,no
Delta Air Lines,5,R Williams,24th September 2013,On both outbound (Atlanta) and inbound (Manchester) the controller in my seat did not work (same fault L/R control not working) fortunately my wife was not using hers so changed seats. Really annoying on longer flights. Service good legroom as ever poor. Atlanta airport terminal improved beyond all measure actually pleasurable experience after zoo on previous occasions.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,3,1,,4,yes
Delta Air Lines,1,Betty Pentier,22nd September 2013,I had flown to SFO from LHR trip with Air France which was fantastic. My return flight with Delta was anything but. SFO-ATL then to LHR. Flight to ATL was really bad. The seats were uncomfortable and old. The cabin crew were average at the best of times. There was no food unless you wanted to pay $10 for a box of candy and potato chips. The inflight entertainment was terrible - there were about 3 free things to watch - everything else had to paid for. After already paying a lot of money for a flight airlines then try and nickel and dime you for things like entertainment and food. Next was ATL-LHR. This was no better. Seats were uncomfortable and cramped. I'm only 5'2 and even I was uncomfortable. Entertainment was not great although a step up from the last. The fact that there was no personal controller really irritated me. When the screen is unresponsive the last thing I want to do on a long flight is have my arm up constantly hitting the screen just to get something to work. The cabin crew again were just average. The food was pretty bad and bland. The PA announcements were hard to hear and were of terrible quality. Overall it was a terrible experience. The only good thing about the flight was their safety/welcome video! This was actually well thought out and funny - I actually took notice of it and watched the whole thing on both flights. Too bad they don't put that much thought and effort in to the actual flying part.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
