Jetblue Airways,8,K Leazon,29th September 2018,✅ Trip Verified | Although our flight from Charleston to Boston was delayed (this meaning we could potentially miss our connecting flight from BOS to Munich) Steven at Charleston airport JetBlue check in desk was extremely helpful and did everything he could for us to make our connection.

Jetblue Airways,10,Zach Xavier,27th September 2018,"Not Verified | Boston to Aruba, direct flight. The flight both ways was fantastic! The cabin staff were amazing, understanding, friendly and always helpful, especially when I requested water. The seats were comfy, and the plane was new and clean. It was a very comfortable flight, both ways, plenty of room, the seats were very comfortable and the seated TVs worked most of the time. All in all, it was an excellent flight. JetBlue never disappoints and I recommend them to everyone.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Aruba,September 2018,4,5,5,5,4,4,yes
Jetblue Airways,10,Mei Xu,21st September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Boston to Detroit.

The service is fantastic too!",A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Detroit,September 2018,5,5,5,4,5,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,9,Mathieu Poulin,12th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Me and my family have been flying with Jetblue Airways every year for the past 15. Sometimes situations are beyond their control. Late staff, weather, lack of disclosure due to uncertainty, etc. Experienced it all. However, what really bothers me I forgot something on the plane on the flight from San Francisco to Boston, realized it as I exited the plane. Have told the staff right away, made a formal claim at the airport within half hour. I haven't retrieved the item yet. 3 weeks later. You leave anything behind and it's gone, no way another passenger would have found it in the deep pocket. They couldn't care less. Employees go first I guess. No work ethic whatsoever. Deeply disappointed.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Boston,August 2018,4,4,4,5,1,4,yes
Jetblue Airways,1,G Andrews,8th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Boston to Ft Lauderdale. I can't begin to express my anger and aggravation for JetBlue. First, the seats on the flight were horrible. My lower back was flaring up after the 3 hr flight from BOS to FLL. But the worst part of this all, they lost my luggage. I don't have the ""normal"" black or red luggage. No, this was a bright yellow duffel dry-bag. One would think that with today's technology of bar code scanning that they would have been able to locate my luggage immediately. Not only do they lose it, their poor customer service made the process much worse. After a week, they handed my case to a ""specialist"" and he basically did nothing. Couldn't even return my voicemails when I asked that he call me back. I'm disgusted with this airline.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Ft Lauderdale,August 2018,1,3,,1,3,3,no
Jetblue Airways,9,C Maleeb,6th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK to Portland. I am flying with JetBlue for the first time and I didn't have high expectations for a domestic flight. I just wanted to give hat's off to JetBlue because it really exceeded my expectations. Very comfortable seats! Free wifi throughout the flight, free snacks and drinks. It was a really enjoyable experience.",,Business,Economy Class,New York JFK to Portland,September 2018,5,5,5,3,4,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,1,Kayla Mize,3rd September 2018,✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK to Boston. JetBlue was the worst flying experience. We were flying internationally and our return flight to RDU from JFK was cancelled unexpectedly by JetBlue with no notification. We rescheduled our flight immediately with Jetblue as we were boarding our international flight and would not have access to phones in order to ensure we were not abandoned at JFK. JetBlue then refused to reschedule our flight closer to our original book time. We also originally paid for a direct flight and we were placed on a layover flight away from our destination. They offered no compensation. Worst airline. Will never fly again. I am strongly encouraging all I know to choose any other airline available. Customer service was awful.,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Boston,September 2018,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Jetblue Airways,10,Rosemary Sweeney,22nd August 2018,"Not Verified | On 8/19/18, My husband and I were checking in for our return flight from Las Vegas to Long Beach at the Jet Blue kiosk. I am six months pregnant and had a medical emergency which led to me bleeding all over the floor in front of a few staff members. The staff at JetBlue immediately took action to help the situation. They could tell that we were in shock and embarrassed. Not only did they get us a wheelchair and called for an ambulance but also called to have the mess cleaned up right away. The staff took our bags, stored them and had them delivered to the hospital. Also booked us on a flight when I was discharged from the hospital all free of charge! Upon our arrival to the gate we were met with flowers, a card signed by the staff and a teddy bear for the baby! This was so unexpected and we are truly touched by the kindness and generosity of the Jet Blue staff!! I wish I knew all of their names however we are so full of gratitude for the above and beyond customer service & care we were shown.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Long Beach to Las Vegas,August 2018,,,,5,5,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,1,Angela Newman,19th August 2018,"Not Verified | Newark to Orlando. To say that my experience with JetBlue was horrible would be an understatement. My flight to Orlando was scheduled to take off at 9:08pm Friday night. After sitting in the airport for over and hour with no information, we found out our flight would be delayed until 1:15am. This is where things went downhill fast. After a significant lack of communication from the staff, our flight was delayed and pushed back another four times making false promises that the flight was on its way. We had asked question after question with little to no response and less than helpful information. After waiting for almost 8 hours in the airport, seeing plane after plane from other airlines leave the airport, we are told that our plane is still in Baltimore (completely irreverent to its route) and would not be arrriving in Newark due to the pilot being “timed out”. They of course got our hopes up once more by telling us they would be getting a substitute plane and crew to take us to Orlando. After waiting ANOTHER hour. They cancelled the flight and left the entire waiting area in a panic. When searching for an alternate flight, not only were they few and far between, but JetBlue had serged all their prices for remaining flights and I paid almost $2,500 one way for four tickets with a layover in a Fort Meyers as my only option to get us to our vacation in enough time to actually enjoy it. JetBlue should be ashamed of these events and the way they conduct business. I will never fly this airline again.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Orlando,August 2018,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Jetblue Airways,1,S Peach,19th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Portland to New York. A horrific display of incompetence by one of the ground staff as they backed into the plane breaking their bumper of the towing vehicle and delayed our flight that put it behind a long list of other delayed flights. I am typing this, having been delayed for several hours as we sit on the tarmac. The staff is rude and on edge. They don't want to answer any questions by the customers in the plane. The staff doesn't seem to know what they are doing and have made a mildly annoying experience into a truly terrible one. We will not be flying with Jet Blue ever again.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to New York,August 2018,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Jetblue Airways,2,Julio Suiqero,13th August 2018,✅ Trip Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Medellin. I am disappointed. This is the second time I flew with JetBlue in less than a month and both of them I had to change plans due to inconsistency on their times. I either missed the next flight connection or departure way too late to ruined plans. Jet Blue is economical but it gives me a sense that they overbook more than other airlines creating more stress on their passengers due to the lack availability.,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Medellin,August 2018,3,3,,,2,3,no
Jetblue Airways,1,M Kaye,13th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Jacksonville. First and last experience with this airline. Thinking back...I should have clued in to what might lay ahead with this airline since we departed JAX for JFK on another airline and I had noticed then that several of the JetBlue flights had been canceled that were leaving around the same time as ours and our Delta flight departed as scheduled. We had booked JetBlue for our return flight and had arrived on an international flight so had 7 hr layover. Another clue that I should have picked up on, the enormous customer service line located at the JetBlue gate area and the number of people that were crying. After waiting 5 hrs for our scheduled flight we were advised 2 hrs prior to departure that our flight was canceled. Waited in line 1.5 hrs for the agent to tell us they had no available flights for our family of 5 to to get out of New York until 3 days later - no compensation for accommodations - there were cots in baggage claim to sleep on and, in addition, this airline does not work with other airlines to look for other travel availability - only what is available in the JetBlue system. We are a family that travels frequently and realize there can always be issues with travel due to weather and other related issues; however, this airline has no alternative options to get you where you need to go in a reasonable timeframe other than what is in their airline inventory. We had an extra day to allow for issues which would normally be sufficient for any of the other airlines we have flown. We ended up Ubering to Philadelphia to rent a car and make a 17 hr drive to our destination all on our dime which cost about $300 more than the airline tickets for all 5 of us. Oh, but they did offer us a refund - how generous! No, we will not ever book with JetBlue again if the choice is ours and I will tell everyone I know about our experience to warn them about this airline. Bottom line, if it’s important for you to actually get to your destination as you booked it and you don’t have some major flexibility with your plans, this is not a bargain in the least.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Jacksonville,August 2018,1,1,,,1,1,no
Jetblue Airways,1,L Meale,13th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Cancun to New York. I am beyond disgusted with my experience with Jet Blue. Our flight on the way to Cancun was delayed due to “a flight attendant not making it on time” and our flight going back to JFK is delayed every 30 mins to another hour later. Our originally scheduled flight that was leaving at 12:30 became 1:30 then 2:10 then 3:10 then 3:44 and so on and so forth until we arrived at the 6:30 pm time. Instead of being honest about the delay from the very beginning, jetblue continued to send those emails leaving me at the airport for over 7-8 hours and my puppy at home alone without any secondary options. When I called for Help, it was not the service level you could’ve expected. I hung up the phone unsatisfied and even more disappointed than before. With every employee giving me a different answer such as “JFK has shut down all incoming and outgoing flights” - not true as there was another Jetblue flight that came in to “the flight is in the air and will arrive soon”- also not true as the flight hasn’t even left off yet. We have waited 8 hours so far and are expected to wait another 6-7 hours. Jetblue just continuously lie and lie and lie.

Jetblue Airways,1,Hank Altschuler,11th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Ft Lauderdale to Albany. Worst airline I have ever flown. They lied to us for hours as we sat on the plane and then the terminal.

Jetblue Airways,1,P Lamella,11th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Orlando to New York. I will never fly JetBlue again. After canceling our first direct flight and changing it to a flight the next day with a layover (with my two little ones), to a return flight that was delayed 6 hours for maintenance issues (the man at the counter said he recommend trying to change our flight because something is ""very very wrong with the plane). They put us on a new flight where they tried to seat my three year old by herself and said we could only sit together if we paid an upgrade charge of $40 per ticket. Only after speaking with a supervisor did they refund that money. After all of this,they lost one of our bags and left the rest of our bags in a rainstorm. Everything is soaking wet and anything electronic ruined. Last night they told us they had our missing bag, but now they say they haven't found it at all and can't do anything to compensate for what's inside (owlette monitor, summer baby monitor, etc). I find the customer service unacceptable and do not recommend flying with them especially if you have young children and value your things you entrust to them.",,Family Leisure,Business Class,Orlando to New York,August 2018,1,3,2,2,1,1,no
Jetblue Airways,1,J Stanton,9th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Nashville to Boston. I would recommend staying away from Jetblue. I really don't think they know what they are doing. I flew with them in January 2018 for the first time as Travelocity gave me this airline option. I was stuck at the FLL airport for an over 6 hour delay. The staff kept giving different reasons as to why the plane was late, they offered junk food as a consolation, and ultimately, it was chaos and very anxiety-provoking. Now, I know they travel a lot to the east coast and it was January, which would likely cause some flight delays. So, I figured I could be fair and give them another try later on as they did give me a $100 flight credit, per their bill of rights. I was very anxious about it, so for about a month before my flight, I checked my flight every single night that I'd be flying on to see if there were major delays again. I needed to be mentally prepared and if it looked rough, I was just going to pay for something else. Well, other than most Saturdays and one Friday, the flight from Nashville to Boston (7:37 PM departure time) was delayed. However, it was at most about a three hour delay, at best 30 minutes. I was mentally prepared, though, and ready for my likely at worst 3 hour delay. I mean, I live in Nashville, so no biggied if I am delayed out of my own city but what a surprise when I get a text that my 7:37 PM flight was delayed until 12:54 AM! We didn't leave Nashville until 2:19 AM! I got into Boston at 6:30 AM and I should have been there at 11:00 PM the night prior. So, my Saturday was very rough considering I only had 2 hours of airplane sleep. When I had talked with customer service during the delay fiasco, they were of no help. One rep literally told me ""good luck"" and hung up. Also, I am glad I didn't try to get on the flight that next morning from Nashville to Boston because it was cancelled. I felt so lucky that I didn't trust Jetblue enough to book them for my flight home. I flew Southwest home and of course, no problems, per usual. So, I'd stay away from Jetblue. I gave them a second chance and it was basically the same situation as the first time I flew with them. I learned my lesson. I will pay more for dependability, no doubt about that.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Boston,August 2018,5,3,,,1,1,no
Jetblue Airways,2,H Marsh,9th August 2018,✅ Trip Verified | New York to Phoenix. Coming and going there was delays. Seats are broken down and won’t lean back on either trip. Cabin pressure is horrible so be ready to be tortured as you descend. Crew doesn’t understand customer service and seems to hate their job. No first class seating just their extended seat but what’s the point when it’s all old nasty seats.

Jetblue Airways,1,Johanna Cruz,7th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Philadelphia to Boston. Please do not waste your time or money flying with this service. JetBlue is the worst. Pay the extra money and fly with a reliable air service. Booked a flight Aug 3rd 2018 from Philadelphia to San Juan PR with 1 stop in Boston. 2 hrs prior to boarding received a text message flight was delayed - every few minutes there after kept getting delayed messages until finally they cancelled the flight minutes before we were supposed to board. No explanation only compensation was rebooking for the 5th which made no sense since I was due to return on the 7th. Terrible customer service too. Employees at stand laughing and clowning around. I requested a full refund and instead the employee rebooked me without my consent - spent 30 more mins on the phone to get refund. My entire trip ruined. Do not waste your time. This is a common trend for JetBlue to cancel flights. Terrible service. Pay a little more to fly with reliable air service. Don't take the chance .

Jetblue Airways,1,Pedro Suarez,7th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Newark to Fort Lauderdale. On August 2nd 2018 we had the worse experience with Jetblue. Sitting in the airport we got an email, not even a phone call that flight was cancelled. The Jetblue staff couldn't get the computer to over ride the new reservations they were trying to make. Finally got re-booked through Tampa and then Silver Air to Fort Lauderdale. As I was boarding I was told I had a seat change due to a child flying by themselves. No prior warning at all by the Jetblue crew. I was separated from my party. The Silver Air flight was also delayed and a propeller plane that seats 36 people. Not what we paid for. Jetblue response was a $25 goodwill credit. That is more of an insult to me. There are way better choices then this airline. They used to be great.

Jetblue Airways,1,S Powell,4th August 2018,Not Verified | Nassau to Fort Lauderdale. Worst airline I’ve ever used. They canceled the flight while we were waiting at the gate and basically told everyone good luck. There were no other flights for 4 days so my kids first vacation in 3 years was canceled. Then I had to wait hours to get my bags back so I could leave. The staff were apologetic and it seemed like they were used to taking abuse for canceled flights but there wasn’t anything they could do to help anyone. I’ve flown other airlines that have had to cancel flights but they all either sent another plane or send larger planes for the next flight to get the people where they needed to be. JetBlue didn’t try to do anything to get anyone anywhere. I will never use them again I’d rather not travel if they are my only option.

Jetblue Airways,1,Ayush Rajbhandary,28th July 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Sarasota. After travelling 30+ hours from Nepal on Qatar Airways with my two kids, I had a connecting flight on Jetblue to Tampa. What should have been a 3 hrs. fight, turned into a 5 days ordeal. We were on the Initial flight on the 22nd of July which left the gate and then after being in the tarmac for 3 hrs, they returned us back to the terminal because the delay caused one of the crew to be above legal flying time allowed. Our initial flight was eventually cancelled at around 2:00 AM the next day and they gave no compensation citing the cancellation was because of weather. I had to be in the line for more than an hour to book our flights for the next day. I was told we were booked for the next day flight, but when we reached the gate the next day, they told us we didn't have any confirmed seats in any of the JetBlue flights. Same thing happened for a couple of days. Finally, after 4 days, they gave me an option to fly out to Sarasota. In between, they told me they had misplaced my luggage and was asked for me to find out where my luggage was. So, after 5 days, without any luggage, they put me in a flight to a different destination and to top it off, they put us in completely different areas of the aircraft and while I was trying to console my 7-year-old to go sit with a stranger, the flight attendant asks us to take our seat promptly. Please do not fly JetBlue, because they have zero passenger concern, they seriously need to fire the guy who manages the flights and reorganize. They were completely disorganized, desk and the person on the phone telling me I had confirmed flights, while the gate told me I didn't have any.

She refused to help me find another flight on another carrier. To keep my interview I have to book our new flight from different airline which can take me to Boston next day and it cost us extra $253/each ticket more. It was horrible and made us crazy to find a last minute flight that didn’t cost $2000. We arrive in Boston at 3pm early morning and JetBlue refuse to refund us extra cost for our new flight.

Jetblue Airways,7,Daryl Ovadia,17th July 2018,"Not Verified | I am reviewing two flights, the first from LAX to JFK. I really like that the airline treats adults as adults and not like children, they have a more hands off attitude, non hovering. The system is quite efficient and flows well. There don't appear to be any meals on board which became a problem on our return from JFK to LAX. The plane was boarded 3 hours late, each update was another 15 minute delay making it impossible to get some food before boarding. We ate a small breakfast thinking we could easily get to our destination as scheduled and eat an early dinner once in LA. The delay made the on flight snacks barely adequate and we were starving once we arrived. There are no healthy snacks, the only offerings are potato chip type bags with carbohydrate and fat loaded ingredients. I guess that's ok if your 20 years old but for many it is undesirable,unhealthy and inadequate. When my wifes Southwest flight was delayed two hours she received a $100 voucher, so far we have seen nothing from Jet Blue and that's okay, we understand delays occur but they need to have contingency preparations in place. There are many things to like about Jet Blue, the seats are very comfortable, the legroom is good, the entertainment screens are excellent. This is an airline that wants to excel, and I think it does, perhaps the decision makers need to take a flight and experience what the traveler experiences and they would understand any deficiencies better. One last thing, the cabin temperature was very cold, I am 63 and needed a jacket, often times I think my age makes me less tolerant of cold but the 30 year old lady sitting next to me had the blanket on and couldn't cover up enough, she was also quite uncomfortable.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Los Angeles,July 2018,5,5,1,5,3,4,yes
Jetblue Airways,1,A Jones,16th July 2018,"Not Verified | This will be my first JetBlue experience and it will be my last. My flight was supposed to leave at 10am this morning- it’s after midnight and I’m still at the airport. After a twice delayed flight that eventually was canceled I was booked on a flight scheduled to leave at 7:48pm. About an hour before the flight it was delayed for 2 hours. Once we received that delay there have been 5 more, now we’re supposed to leave at 2am. The crew here can’t give us clear answers, one minute it’s going to be earlier than they think the next we get another alert of a delay. Multiple other airlines have taken off from CLT to JFK, I’ve even seen a plane return from JFK that took off from CLT while I’ve been waiting. Ultimately I’d like clear, honest answers rather than deliveries of false hope. Also some kind of compensation for the extreme inconvenience would be nice- but so far it’s just been a bottle of water - disappointed to say the least.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to New York,July 2018,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Jetblue Airways,1,M Sarduy,15th July 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Los Angeles. Gate agents in LAX are extremely rude. JetBlue must have many complaints because they refuse to let customers speak with a supervisor. All communication is done through the dearjetblue site. It’s a useless back and forth where nothing gets accomplished. Furthermore, their small credit vouchers are for future use on the airline. Once again, useless for customers who no longer wish to fly JetBlue. There are other options for paying customers.

Jetblue Airways,2,M Gillot,13th July 2018,✅ Trip Verified | JetBlue has become a horrible airline to fly with. On this four and a half flight there were several issues. I upgraded to more space seats for $170 because the airline strategically blocks off many of the seats so that you cannot sit with your spouse. There was no entertainment on this flight. The wifi did not work either. Apparently their entire systems were down according to the announcement. They would give you a $15 voucher IF you booked through them but would have to jump through hoops because the booking was done through Expedia. As soon as we took off the staff made an announcement that there were no sandwiches or salads available on this flight for sale. Thanks for letting us know after boarding. The plane itself was old and dirty. The seat was hard as a wood plank due to the foam material degrading. Also the cabin was freezing cold and had to spend $5 per blanket to keep warm because they would not increase cabin temperature. Worse flight I've taken in a while and that's saying something since I rarely complain.,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Aruba to Boston,July 2018,1,2,1,1,3,1,no

Jetblue Airways,7,Philip Ahearn,10th July 2018,"Not Verified | While my trip was for the most part satisfactory, the return trip from Tampa to Westchester was problematic to say the least. I dealt with not only an extremely rude flight crew, but the crew onboard the aircraft did little to keep the passengers updated with the status of our delay. Due to a ""cracked taxi light,"" the flight was delayed and the flight crew notified us twice, the first notification came when we were initially told about the need for repairs and a ""tape up"", and the second came over an hour later when we were told that ""we would be getting on our way shortly."" The trip down to Tampa from New York was more than satisfactory, but that return trip was problematic from the very start. I shared the sentiment of a frequent flyer one row behind me, who was very vocal about her disappointment with the airline and their handling of the delay. Despite these things, there was a very nice selection for entertainment which included free in-flight TV service and WiFi (which came as a shock to me). Overall it was not an amazing experience and I would recommend this airline, but it would be a matter of comparison.

Jetblue Airways,2,M Beale,1st July 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Never Again! I travel from NJ to Boston several times a year to visit family. Since I have 2 small children, ages 4 and 7, sometimes I fly because it is generally quick and easy. The Newark to Boston flight was slightly delayed and my tv did not work but was otherwise uneventful. The trip home from Boston to Newark was a nightmare. My family lives over an hour from the airport and on the drive I got a text from the airline stating the flight will be delayed an hour. We were having some bad weather so that was understandable. I just had to try to entertain my kids for a bit longer in the airport. We boarded the flight at the delayed time and sat on the aircraft for over half an hour just to be told by the pilot they did not get clearance from Newark and ""it may be another hour"" for take off. They let us deplane. After dragging my kids further around he airport to get snacks and games,I noticed that every single JetBlue flight in the terminal was extremely delayed. We returned to the gate to see a big cancelled on the flight board. No announcement made. We were then told to go to customer service to see about getting another flight. After sitting in an airport for hours, I now had to drag my kids to another spot to wait in a very long line. At the desk, the rep told me the flight was canceled because the delays caused the crew to ""time out"". Basically they up and left stranding a whole plane of people with nowhere to go. The rep offered me options on another flight which would land at a NY airport over 2 hours from my home or an 8 pm flight that she told me would most likely be delayed. Neither were reasonable options for my situation. I chose to take a flight at noon the next day since my kids were at their limits of patience. I asked for compensation since I would have to get a hotel for the night and was told no it was not their fault since they canceled for ""weather"". (Seems to me like the crew abandoning ship was why they canceled). Meanwhile other airlines were flying no problem. Now I had to drag my 2 exhausted kids through the airport to reclaim my bags and hope to secure accommodation for the night. I was told that most of the hotels at the airport were booked but the reservation agent at Logan found me a hotel 10 miles outside of the city. We had to wait for a shuttle during rush hour in the rain. A 15 minute ride turned into 40 minutes. What should have been a quick easy 45 minute flight turned into a 24 hour nightmare. It was needlessly stressful and exhausting.I felt like I was left stranded with 2 small kids. It had been a couple of years since I flew JetBlue and I used to love them. Not anymore. From the other reviews I read it seems like my experience is not uncommon. I will pay extra to use United next time, or Amtrak. I will not be using JetBlue anymore.

Jetblue Airways,2,Kimberly Guessferd,30th June 2018,Not Verified | New York to West Palm Beach. Getting there was ok although I didn’t get the chance to pick my seats so we had to ask people to move since we traveled with children. They cancelled my flight home which was totally inconvenient. We were then booked for the next day and couldn’t stay an extra day so they rebooked us but to fly out of another airport and had less than 3 hours to get ready to go since the time also changes. So we raced to pack say goodbye and leave. We didn’t have any time to put gas in our rental car and had to just drop it off and pay the outrageous fee for gas. Finally got to the new airport and again had to ask people to move so we could sit with our children.

At the check in they had no vacant seats together so they didn’t assign me a seat, saying they will do that at the gate. At the gate they gave us seats 7B, 19D and 24D!! That meant My 5 years old child was seating alone 5 rows behind me. The Jet Blue personnel is absolutely unprofessional, they didn’t even apologize, and just blamed us by saying that we supposed to come earlier. The whole situation is ridiculous! Jet Blue’s decision was: to put us on another flight or fly as it is! We asked a few people to change their seats but they refused the suggestion. When I buckled up My child he couldn’t understand what is going on and of course started to cry. He didn’t want to be separated or to sit with someone he didn’t know, even though the couple next to him was very sweet. I was too stressed to deal with this and tried to talk to him about it. One of the passengers started to go around and ask people and finally she managed to put us together. I am so thankful to that woman.

Jetblue Airways,3,L Shipman,25th June 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Extremely disappointed. I've actually been recommending Jetblue Airways even though it has the lowest rating. We had a weather delay which is understandable. We deplaned at the 3 hour mark. We sat at the gate an additional hour and half waiting for further instruction when we were told the flight was cancelled, to get our bags and call the 1-800 number for further assistance. The crew walked off saying they were off duty. The 800 number representatives refer you back to the airport staff which now we can't speak with as we were no longer in the security area. The retrieving of bags was a total mess, it took at least 2 hours for our bags to get pulled off due to so many cancellations. Now I have to wait 2 days to get a flight out not even comparable to the original booking. Isn't a whole plane full of cancelled people enough to add the additional flight that's already been paid for? The worst thing is Delta flew in the same weather, they never deplaned and actually got off the ground and to their destination. I was also told ""the system world automatically rebook my flight"". When I enquired about this process there was no clear understanding by the representative as to how this even happens.

Jetblue Airways,1,Mark Albright,22nd June 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | We were done in Boston and went to the airport. We had boarding passes for 10 pm flight. Most airlines let you fly standby same day as it gives them more opportunities to sell higher tickets later. Checkin manager could not care less. $150 to fly earlier. We went to the gate and none of their employees would help. 4 planes left with empty seats. Is that good customer service? Why advertise and send us ""specials"" every Tuesday if that is how you treat good customers? We can talk about the nonworking direct tv, or joke website which does not save info, kicks you off and has not improved in 15 years with the internet or flight delays when it is convenient for you, but you rudely treat good customers and train employees not to use common sense.

In flight wifi that includes free messaging. In flight TV channels. Cons: Very limited number of airports they fly in and out of within the US. Their planes have an outdated interior, like really outdated. TV screens on the back of seats that are super pixelated and are no bigger than 5'x5' squares. This is your only means of watching the inflight TV channels and movies. The movies have to be started at the beginning of your flight, they start on their own channel and can't be paused. They charge $80+ for the exit row. I personally had a not great experience on my flight home when our six hour flight was delayed due to ""catering"" only to then be told that catering couldn't make it to our plane so they just left without the food for the flight. I also ended up in a seat with a broken headphone jack that only emitted a high pitched squeal so I couldn't watch the tv. The TV tray at my seat was also broken, causing anything on it to slide into the aisle. I reported all these things to JetBlue, only to be told that my trouble was worth a $15 refund.

We got expedited security clearance too. We boarded on time and got seated. Our flight attendants came round and introduced themselves and asked if this was our first time flying mint. Our amenity kits and a little note were left on the seat. They came round with noise cancelling headphones for everyone. They asked if we would like a drink and myself and my husband chose the refresh mint cocktail. They came round and cleared cups before we took off. Bottles of water provided at every seat in advance. Seat was super comfortable I loved the fact the offer directTV entertainment this was great. The inflight wifi worked perfect and I could stream facebook live. The food again was lovely we ordered the plane eats menu and everything was tasty. The only slight gripe was that the croutons on the salad were soggy. But that's all I could say. Excellent selection of alcoholic drinks. Ice cream for pudding and I chose a lovely freshly brewed coffee. A decent choice of wines with our meal. I settled down as we flew at night and got around 3 hours sleep. It was lovely. The duvet pillow and seat were all comfortable. Cabin and toilets all clean.

We were trying our best to soothe her down but nothing was helping. This was totally unexpected. When the airline was contacted, they did apologize, but at the same time, they reiterated that the air hostess did not do anything wrong.

As we were going on vacation, it was too late to change or cancel accommodations and car rental. I was told by two supervisors that my only options were to wait until the next flight which was 2 days away, make a 4.5 hr drive to Atlanta for a flight tomorrow, or just get a refund of the cost of my flight. They refused to help me find another flight on another carrier. As we already had several thousand dollars invested in this vacation, I had no choice but to do all the legwork and somehow manage to find a last minute flight that didn't cost $2,000. I did get one (thank goodness), that had multiple stops, was 3 hours longer and didn't get in until after midnight. I called Jetblue back to have them refund my flight and see if they could refund me the extra $269.00 it cost for my new flight. They refused and said they would only refund the cost of the flight and give a $100 flight voucher for my 'inconvenience'. Beware of Jetblue when there are problems, if you've read anything on this page you should see that they are ill prepared for issues or to compensate customers for what could be severe financial burdens.

The JetBlue staff stated that specific plane was ready for take off to San Juan PR and was not prepared to travel to Fort Lauderdale with that much fuel and had to wait for the fuel service to come and fix the problem. My sister and I had our children with us and had to board the carnival cruise by 3:30pm at the Miami port which is at least 45mins away from Fort Lauderdale with traffic. We did not leave Bradley until about 10:10am. So as you figured we did not make it in time to board our cruise for my sons 8th birthday. We did not receive a dime back and had to return flight back home the next morning. Seeing we are in spring and it was an early enough flight we did not think insurance was necessary.

On the way home we were delayed an hour on the flight from Punta Cana to FL and then our flight from FL to Charleston delayed an hour and a half (no explanation why). Every single flight was delayed. Not like a ten minute delay but an hour or more. Incredibly frustrating. And only one flight attendant we encountered was actually friendly. Will fly any other airline if at all possible.

The seats did not recline and they were next to the bathroom. For our return flight we had to change the day and when we did that the airline associate we spoke to said they would not put us in the back on our return flight. Oddly enough, when we arrived in JFK for our return flight we were told we had the seats in the back of the plane, again. The associate at the gate was extremely rude when we said that we were told that we would not get those seats. Bottom line is this airline has no integrity. We’re very disappointed.

Jetblue Airways,1,Jordan Woods,24th April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Fort Lauderdale. This was without a doubt, the worst traveling experience I've ever encountered. We sat on the terminal for over two hours, waiting to 'de-ice.' Mind you, I counted over 10 planes come in and take off while we continued to sit there. With the whole flight crew knowing that they had over 85% of the flight needing to be on time with their connecting flights. We were assured that the crew did not know any information and they could do nothing to help us. Once we landed, the captain casually said that we were over two hours late. He never apologized for the horrible landing or terrible timing that had occurred. Then we were advised to go the help desk and we would be assisted there. They had one staff member helping our whole flight. We weren't booked to fly out until the next day, in which we had to fight to get a hotel to stay in for over night. Jet Blue did not care about anyone's time management or money. Every single flight that we had or saw was delayed.

Jetblue Airways,2,Sara Castellan,15th April 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Fort Lauderdale. I am very disappointed in my recent flying experience with Jet Blue. My boyfriend and I were traveling to Cancun for a getaway, on the way there we had a connecting flight to Fort Lauderdale with a layover time of 43 minutes. We were delayed as the plane needed to be deiced prior to takeoff, which set us back 25 minutes. Our flight was a smooth flight, landing in fort Lauderdale 22 minutes prior to us needing to get on our connecting. However, due to us arriving a bit later than scheduled time we had no gate to run into therefore waited on the runway for 20 minutes, causing us to miss our connecting. We were informed by the pilot that he got confirmation from the pilot that they would hold the doors. The crew allowed us to get off the plane first and race (and mean race) to our gate. Jetblue closed the doors 1 minute prior to us getting to our gate. We ran to the desk however the gentlemen informed us we were too late the doors have already been closed. I informed him the pilot was aware we were minutes late however he said that’s too bad once the doors are closed they are closed. The customer service received at the help desk was ridiculous. The attendant advised us there was nothing they could do other than put us on the next flight which was scheduled for the next day. I told them that was in 24 hours from now and they said we could sleep in the airport. We requested to speak to a manager as we were receiving little help or support. 1 hour later no manager arrived. I phoned JetBlue and advised them of our situation and in turn they offered us a free stay at a nearby hotel. Better than sleeping on a stiff airport chair. I am writing this review so customers/future customers flying with JetBlue can see the hassle my boyfriend and I went through. I am thankful we received a night however if a gate would have been opened we never would have had to spend 3 hours at the airport trying to make alternative arrangements and would have enjoyed the day/night paid for at the all inclusive resort. Not a good way to spend your anniversary! I would also like to add - if you are connecting to another flight using the same airline and you are Within minutes of reaching your gate, the pilots should communicate with each other.

Seems 20 minutes after dropping off the rental car we get the delay notice, 1 hour, getting updates but been here for six hours now. We could have stayed in the rental and enjoyed the days, instead we are sitting with about 600 customers. The delay is due to a breakdown with the plane. I asked at the other gates that were delayed and all stated there was a concern with the plane. I guess I have no choice as I am stuck here. Please stay away from airlines they do not care about your time or there delays as it not there time they are wasting.

First flight they delayed it 4 times; but it was a morning flight and I still got to my destination; dealt with it 2nd flight traveling to New York, canceled my flight 15 minutes before it was supposed to take off. Put me on a new flight which was delayed 3 times. Got to New York, lost my luggage, delivered it to me 2 days later, completely ruined. Third flight (current situation) convinced all friends to fly with them since I had a credit from the last experience. Flight to Vegas for best friends bachelorette. Had a limo waiting for us upon pick up that was paid for and bought tickets to a show as well. Flight delayed four times now. I called after the first time and the guy said it was due to weather, so I was understanding, you can’t control the weather - delayed the second time and the guy at the counter said it was due to the plane not leaving Havana Cuba yet. Delayed a 3rd time; getting pretty frustrated at this point and call again. They can only say sorry. Doesn’t help me. Then delayed a 4th time. It’s now not supposed to leave until 12:45AM. Our entire night is cancelled and ruined. I looked at the board and it looked like every Jetblue flight was delayed. I promise they used to be good; but they aren’t anymore. If you want to get to your destination on time, fly with Delta, American, or even Spirit I would say is better now. Less amenities but more reliable.

Many channels and things to choose from.The wifi is free and worked very well. Now to the bad things. There was only 1 flight attendant and he wasn't the best. Service started late and it was done in an unprofessional manner. The website said there would be snackboxes on this flight but he did not have any which was disappointing.

When we arrived the Jetblue folks said we may be able to make the earlier flight, but then quickly said we could not. We went to the gate of the earlier flight and they said it would be a $75 per person change fee. Our flight was already delayed but they would not waive the fee. So, now our flight is delayed 90 minutes and we will now have at least a 5.5 hour lay over because JetBlue would not give us open seats. They said it is policy. The reason I fly Jetblue was because I liked that they were customer friendly - not like American or United. This policy contradicts that belief.

Jetblue Airways,1,C Marlen,20th March 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to Orlando. From 3:49pm to 7:30pm I received multiple emails of flight delays, then corrected to on time, then delayed, then on time, then delayed from 10pm departure to 1am departure. I called the airline to complain that this did not seem as a weather delay even though it was insisted multiple times that it was, but as internal issues, seeing as they knew the plane from NY was delayed to us by 2 hours and we kept receiving multiple changes. You can track a plane on flight aware and know when it will take off and land. I explained my case and the manager states “so you want a refund”. I said I think that is fair seeing as this is clearly not a weather delay because you can track the plane that was supposed to pick us up, and the airline knew since 3:49pm it was not going to make it. She refunded my money but did not say anything about cancelling our tickets. Maybe I am just ignorant, but I thought the airline was refunding my money because they valued their clients. Thankfully we realized she cancelled our tickets because the App no longer found our reservation. I called back to in fact confirm with a live person a manager cancelled my reservation without telling me, then had to void the refund, was charged again, and received our places back on the flight. Now I am sitting exhausted in the airport, as I write, being told the flight was delayed actually by a mechanical issue. Not by a flight delay from the planes previous destination, as I expected all along. But at least my husband and I have a ticket to board and didnt get to the airport with no reservation because the woman failed to tell me she completely cancelled our flight. That would have been another aggravating battle to deal with. What are we supposed to stay in Salt Lake City for the rest of our lives?!?

On the way back from San Francisco’s to NY, the plane was maybe 30% full and mostly empty. We kindly waited for everyone to board to see if the row in front of us which had a few extra inches of leg room would be vacant (I am 6’3 so those extra inches would make a big difference). When the plane doors closed and we were ready to roll, I kindly asked the flight attendant to let me move one row up considering it was empty, she immediately went on the most uncomfortable rant about extremely strict policies (which isn’t true I fly with JetBlue and virgin airlines only and always had very nice flight crews tell me absolutely no problem as long as no one sits here when the doors are shut, feel free) long story short the flight attendant was so adamant about not letting me move even though the plane was more than half empty and it was so unpleasant considering I love this airline along with virgin airline. I will no longer fly JetBlue for this reason and this is all about principle. Extremely uncomfortable situation to pretend like they can’t move you whatsoever. I will only fly virgin from now on.

I had read many reviews about delayed flights and other inefficiencies, but I wanted to experience it for myself. My two flights to CTG departed on time with no issues. While returning, my second flight was delayed by hours. The delay was due to the wrong plane being assigned. I explained to the associate my concerns because I would be missing my train and would either have to spend hundreds on a hotel or almost $80 on an Uber. The associate explained that nothing is in her control and that JetBlue would not be able to provide a voucher. Customer service was called and they stated the same thing. I ended having to get a hotel room for almost $200 and purchase another train ticket home.

Jetblue Airways,3,E Gallinez,10th January 2018,"✅ Trip Verified | Santo Domingo to Newark. Very disappointed with the service provide by JetBlue. Everything started with the storm Grayson. My flight was on January 4th from Santo Domingo to JFK New York. That day they kept us all day updating the board with the delay flight sign to let us know at the end of the day that the flight was cancelled. I was supposed to stay in The Dominican Republic for 10 days but end up staying for 15 days. Calling my job everyday to keep them updated about the situation that I was going through. At the end I think they didn’t even believe me, because every day I have to explain my boss how Jetblue couldn’t find two seat to accommodate my boyfriend and I. I paid for those five days out of my pocket to stay in a hotel close by the airport because every flight the put my boyfriend and I were cancelled every day for those 5 DAY. My flight was supposed to be a non stop flight because I HATE to do Laid over, but guess what the only flight the had available was with a laid over in ft. Lauderdale. I ended up traveling January 8th at 4:00am from Santo Domingo to ft. Lauderdale. When I was in lauderdale had to wait till 7:00pm to get another plane to Newark not being Newark my flight destination. Because when I bought my flight it was from JFK to Santo Domingo “straight flight” and my returns was supposed to be Santo Domingo to JFK not Newark “straight flight too” I spent almost 24 hours to get a flight which last just 3:45hrs. And the funny thing when I got to ft. Lauderdale I went to one of the JetBlue representatives to asks him that please if there were an earlier flight available because I think is was ridiculous to wait 10 hours in an airport for another flight, but the guys told me in order for him to do that I had to pay 75 dollars for me and 75 dollars for my boyfriend because I was trying to change the reservation that they already gave me. Even thought I explain him that I had an nonstop flight, but because of the situation of the storm they didn’t give me any choice but to accept the laid over. I end up paying almost 2,000 dollars between the hotel, food and transportation from my hotel to the Santo Domingo airport and once I got to Newark I had to take a taxis to JFK parking lot because I left my car parked over there to avoid paying for taxi.

Apparently they cannot make accommodations for someone if a flight is cancelled due to weather even if they are legitimately disabled. I am severely disappointed and disturbed. Even after 2 hours on the phone with corporate they cannot do anything to accommodate my disability, because it was a weather cancellation. Apparently if it was cancelled another way they would have been able to. How is having a documented medical disability not an accepted extenuating circumstance?

I then received a few more emails that informed me that my flight was delayed by about an hour and a half. I went and got dinner at the airport, where I got one email about the flight arriving a little earlier, 7:54 instead of 8:09. I made plans to leave dinner to get to the gate at 7:20, where I arrived to find out my flight had left. The emails that the flight was no longer delayed came in at 7:12, and I didn’t see them. JetBlue booked me on another flight with no charge, with a layover in New York that will take much longer to get home. It seems to me like emails about delays should not have been sent out if the flight was going to leave on time. I am disappointed that JetBlue delays every flight I have taken with them, but I am more disappointed now that I thought the flights were delayed as always, and ended up missing my flight, even though I arrived at the airport hours before.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington Dulles to Boston,December 2017,4,4,,4,3,3,no

Changed their policy in October so you can’t get on any earlier flight no matter what without a $75 change fee, even if the flight is only 60% full and you are standing at the gate - and even if you are a true blue member, frequent flyer, and JetBlue credit card holder (I am all 3, have been for almost 10 years). Instead of going home I will be waiting in Fort Lauderdale airport for 4 hours, where I just watched a half full flight board and take off for the same location (because I won’t pay $75!). Not to mention, the crew were confused (albeit very nice though) and sent me to 4 wrong locations just to inquire about the switch.

I booked a flight for my elderly father while he traveled from MA to FL to be with his best friend as he passed. I had called in to see what would happen if my dad either missed the flight, or had to move it up, just to be prepared. The woman on the phone told me there would be a $100 re-booking fee plus the difference in cost of the flight if there was one. She also told me she'd leave a note in my file that this was something I was inquiring about. Unfortunately, my father's best friend passed earlier than expected, and he wanted to get out of there immediately. He asked me to call Jet Blue and book him a ticket for today. I called again, totally willing to pay the fees just to get my father home and out of a sad situation. A woman on the end of the line was an absolute angel. She saw the note in my file and shortly afterwards, my father had a ticket booked home for day, with a seat close to the front, and for much lower than the originally expected cost. She did not have to do this. She made a really tough day a little easier on me and my father. It was very, very sweet, and I feel compelled to write this review out of appreciation.

I've traveled all over the world and I have to say my experience on Jetblue was ""excellent."" Since JFK is 70 miles from my home, I generally would not have traveled to this airport to utilize this airline, but it was well worth the trip. (First time on Jetblue) Honestly, I didn't really appreciate paying $50 for arriving at the customer service desk for another flight for arriving 1 hour prior to departure, but it is what it is. On Tuesday, Oct 24, I flew non-stop from JFK to MBJ and the flight crew on Flight 479 was the best I have ever encountered. Staff were courteous, friendly, and top notch individuals. They were very personable and were generally concerned about the customers. The only other flight crew I encounter this nice was EVA Air last year when traveling from Taipei to Beijing.

Then they claim imaginary JFK airport repairs are causing them to delay a flight by almost 3 hours without sending a prior email to inform us.

We stopped to get coffee next door to our gate (Gate 28) and proceeded to our gate more than 15 minutes prior to departure time only to see the gate had already closed and we were not allowed board our flight, yet our luggage is on the flight. There was not a courtesy page, no announcement of flight boarding, no final boarding announcement, nothing. We had to watch our flight take off in front of us. This is a huge inconvenience because this delays our trip by hours because we had to rebook on another flight which gets us to Charleston at 4:56 pm versus our original arrival of 8:40am.

Staff members refused to elaborate the cause very cold and unprofessional. Upon calling JetBlue customer service the representative failed to give any reasoning and was very unapologetic. To make matters even worse we had the same experience returning to JFK. I recently canceled a trip booked via Expedia due to a medical occurrence and Jetblue nor Expedia are willing to refund my money, even considering the fact I purchased travel insurance (in the event something beyond my control was to happen, resulting in not being able to travel).

Initially, she too saw that the flight was not cancelled. She put me on hold checked further and said that it now showed a weather cancellation.

She did come back - passed my seat many times including asking for drinks - but never mentioned the seat change request again, even though I was visibly unable to get good air and was basically crawling out of my seat. The seatbelt sign stayed on for the first 1.5 hours of the flight even though the air was calm and clear and we had long since flown out of the storms. Did the pilot forget to turn it off?

Over the last 10 years my trips have primarily been to destinations that Jet Blue doesn't cover, but a flight to Syracuse took me back into their flight paths. I was very pleased on my outbound flight to find them just the same and more legroom than I get on international flights. But what made this trip better is that I needed a change in my (non-changeable) flight due to a family emergency and was pretty distraught on the phone. The person assisting me was professional and comforting and took care of getting me on the best flight to get me home, and made a hard trip far far easier. My typical flights are still outside the Jet Blue coverage areas, so I can't fly them as often as I would like after this experience: hoping this review makes up for that.

Jetblue Airways,1,I Pearson,24th August 2017,"✅ Verified Review | My first and probably last time flying Jetblue. Outbound from O'Hare to JFK, we left over 30 minutes late and yet made an on-time arrival. How was that even possible? Pad your flight schedules much? On the way home, we pulled back only a few minutes late but then pulled over and waited on the tarmac for an hour an half. Although we were told that there was weather in between New York and Chicago, passengers got on their phones and found that the weather radar was completely clear. No storms at all. Crew members just gave sheepish grins when told this information. We then had to return to the gate so that a new crew could take over. Passengers were allowed to deplane (with all of their things) and told that they could buy food and then reboard. After another hour or so, all of us (including those who had already boarded the plane twice) were forced off into the terminal with all of our stuff. Five hours after the original departure time, we finally reboarded (some passengers for the third time) and eventually took off. The entertainment system cut in and out the entire trip, going dark for ten minutes at a time. There were no apologies given for that problem or the delays, just a passing thank you ""for your patience"" before the final (re-re)boarding. The crew members were pleasant throughout the ordeal, but they work for a complete joke of an airline. If I were New York, I would force it to remove the ""New York's Airline"" advertising that is up around town-to avoid guilt by association.",A321,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to New York JFK,August 2017,2,4,2,1,1,2,no
Jetblue Airways,8,M Chen,23rd August 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Boston to Cleveland. Jetblue surprises me as a low-cost airline. The staffs were professional and courteous. I ordered two little bottles of white wine, and normally they would charge for it, but the attendant on my flight just said to me: ""don't worry about the payment, enjoy your wine first, I will come back later"", and he never came back to charge me! And I don't think anyone was charged for his drinks. On top of that, eveyone has a screen in front him/her to watch DirectTV, or if the flight is more than two hours, free movies! The Wifi on the flight was also free if you are a member of Jetblue""s frequent flyer program.

I understand this part, but your job is look for another flight way before I called! They made me fly from the Raleigh airport to Boston to get with the surprise that as soon as I got to Boston I found out that my connecting flight to NY got delayed and I won't make it to my final destination! So I go over there trying for them to find me a new flight so I could make it on time and there was none, she told me I had to stay overnight and catch the next flight the next day at 12pm. I did that, I went to my gate and I slept there. Then someone from the airport woke me up and told me I couldn't sleep there and I had to go outside. They cancelled my flight and are kicking me out.

Jetblue Airways,1,K Stanton,15th August 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Orlando to Newark. I booked with JetBlue because I thought it would make my flying experience so much smoother. But on multiple occasions they have made it an absolute nightmare. Upon flying to Costa Rica, my flight was scheduled to depart at 8 AM. They delayed it an hour at a time over seven times and then they completely cancelled the flight at 2PM. There were no other flights from JetBlue until the next day, meaning most of us lost money on hotels, shuttles, and time wasted. They did not give me a credit for the time lost, they just partially refunded me for the ticket since I was also coming back from Costa Rica flying JetBlue. I am now in Orlando, trying to get back home to New Jersey, and the same nightmare is happening again. They delayed it by an hour and a half. Now they've delayed it by another 45 minutes. They are notorious for great customer service if you can actually make it on the plane. I have never had such an absolutely awful experience, and this has happened to me twice within a two week period, at two separate airports. Do not ever book with them unless you want your time wasted and nothing from them as an apology.

Then 11 to 12:30PM. Then 12:30 to 1. Then, after waiting several hours in the airport (since I got there two hours before you depart, 6AM), they cancelled the flight and said there were no more until the following day. I had a shuttle to catch in the morning and it cost $350 to reschedule the shuttle because I was traveling five hours away from the airport. If they had just cancelled it to begin with I could have booked with another airline to make it there on time. I ended up going to a completely different airport and flying with United, who bumped me to first class! I made it to Costa Rica on time because of them. JetBlue gave me more than a headache, it was an absolute disaster of a travel experience, a nightmare, and they offered no compensation other than a refund. They randomly booked me on another flight that I never asked for (I was booking with another airline who could get me there on time), and I had to spend over an hour on the phone with a JetBlue agent to reimburse me the money properly. I am now returning with JetBlue, and the delays have begun again. We are already an hour and forty minutes into the delay.

Jetblue Airways,1,Debra Kearns,11th August 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Richmond to Punta Cana via Fort Lauderdale/Boston. Just perused recent reviews and feel like my story was already told! Numerous times. Worst trip ever - coming and going! Left Richmond VA for Punta Cana, DR via Fort Lauderdale on Aug 3. #645/#173. 2.5 hour delay from FL because apparently, Jetblue neglected to assign a pilot to the flight! Called Jetblue from terminal, and was informed that I must have misunderstood gate employee as no one from Jetblue would ever make such an announcement re: the lack of a pilot! I explained to rep that we were meeting group from NY in DR to share hour transport to hotel that had already been paid for. Rep went on to explain they would need at least 5 days to evaluate who was at fault for the delay of a flight with no pilot assigned and to call back at that time to see if we would be compensated. Needless to say we had to pay another $70.00 for transport to hotel. Return trip: From Punta Cana, DR to Boston (#896) for lay over, then on to Richmond VA.(#1281). Left DR at 12:48 with 5:00 arrival time in Boston to catch a 6:50 connection to Richmond. When we were still in the air at 5:15, expressed concern to flight attendant that we would be unable to get through customs and traverse the entire airport in what was looking like less than an hour. We were assured we would have no problem. Landed and got off plane about 5:35, flew through terminal begging anyone who would listen, customs, Jetblue employees, TSA, etc. that we had a connecting flight. They couldn't care less. Even had Jetblue employee send us in the totally wrong direction dragging 3 suitcases which probably cost us at least 15 precious minutes. Thank God for the other passengers on TSA line who let us cut to front! My poor husband got through 1st and went flying to gate to beg that they await our arrival only to discover flight had already closed doors at 6:35! First we were told there was another flight to Richmond at 7:00. Then we were informed that was a mistake, the next was at 9:00 pm. Asked to speak with supervisor who was only interested in the specifics of our flight times, and then informed us that the problem was with whomever booked our flight as Jetblue always recommends at least 2 hours between connecting flights to avoid exactly what we just went through. When we informed him we had booked the entire trip through Jetblue Vacations, and shouldn't his airline know their own policy, he had nothing to say! In the middle of exchange, another employee came over, whispered in his ear and and he took off-no explanation. After waiting 20 minutes because of course, the supervisor of an airline in the middle of hearing a complaint from one of their customers would return, we went looking for him! Found him behind a counter talking to another employee. Watched for about 5/10 minutes until he turned around and saw me. This guy had no intention of returning to finish our conversation! So-long story short, we got a $40 voucher for food which in airline-ese is 2 hamburgers - found out our luggage had somehow made the very flight we missed and got home to Richmond at midnight. Note: Flight crew on #381 were fabulous, as was unknown employee at Logan check in counter who somehow got our liquor boxed and on flight after another Jetblue employee gave us the totally wrong info on how to transport!",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Richmond to Punta Cana,August 2017,3,3,,,1,1,no

Jetblue Airways,1,N Dawson,5th August 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Ft Lauderdale to Boston. Traveling back from Florida with my wife and two young daughters Jetblue sent me an email at 7:47am, 3 hours before my flight 2020 FLL-Worcester was scheduled to take off at 11:06am, that our flight was canceled. Agents on the phone were no help, only offering a flight leaving at 9:25am as an option. They claimed the flight was canceled for mechanical issues; somehow I don't believe that and this was some sort of cost saving cancellation. We rushed to the airport for the 9:25am flight only to be met by bumbling ticket agents who couldn't process customers quick enough. When it was out turn we were locked out. After running in-between terminals we were re-booked on Flight 376 to Philadelphia with a connection to Boston (yes, not our original destination). Flight 376 which was scheduled to depart at 1:32pm was a fiasco from the start. The flight boarded all passengers only to tell us that we'd be delayed as the flight had no water so they needed to wait for hand sanitizer - this wait was over 40 minutes. Stormy weather blew in, the runway was closed and we missed the window. After several openings and closings of the runway we finally took off at 3:30pm - 2 hours after our scheduled departure. The late takeoff meant we would cut it very close for our connecting flight 660 out of Philadelphia for Boston. I received a notification on my phone that the flight had been delayed till 6pm. With our estimated arrival in Philadelphia of 5:45pm I was hoping we'd be able to just make it. I asked the stewardess to speak with the captain as there were around 15 of us that had our Worcester flight 2020 canceled and were rebooked on these flights. I dreaded the thought of missing my connection because of the plane's lack of water and need for a hand-sanitizer delivery that took 40 minutes. The stewardess returned and said she spoke with the captain who would try to hold the flight. About 10 minutes before our landing another stewardess went on the intercom and told all theBoston bound passengers to relax because our gate was right next to Boston flight 660's E2, and that the plane would wait for us as the captain had called ahead. That was a major relief to hear that news. She also explained that we'd be let off the plane first ahead of other passengers to expedite our plane change. This was also a relief to hear considering my carry-ons and precious kid cargo. I nearly texted my father to pick us up at Logan (he was driving from N. Grafton in Worcester county), but I hesitated, wanting to be 100% sure. Well, unfortunately my apprehension proved deserved. When the door to the plane opened there wasn't any parting of the seas to let us through. In fact, both stewardesses who communicated with us disappeared, presumably shying away from the hidden truth. I yelled aloud whether we were being let off first but no one replied. I then looked out the plane's window - there wasn't any plane at E2 - flight 660 had already taken off! I walked down the gate corridor completely bewildered; the crew members were still nowhere to be seen. Upon exiting the gate, the JetBlue ticket agent handed me a new set of tickets. I asked where flight 660 went? The agent replied that it had taken off at 5:47, 13 minutes ahead of schedule and that we were now rebooked on the 8:41pm flight 760. Needless to say, all Boston bound passengers were furious - not sure if I can fly Jetblue for a while!",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Boston,August 2017,4,1,4,4,1,1,no

The exact quote was ""we guarentee you will be booked on the 11am flight"". I am now at the airport at 10am and our flight has been pushed back to 4.45pm.

Jetblue Airways,1,H Meeson,20th July 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Washington to Boston. This airline is fine should you not actually want to go anywhere. I felt like I was in kindergarten with a make-believe airline. I booked through Emirates. Foolish me, instead of booking a direct flight out of IAD with Emirates, I thought to save several hundred dollars by booking a cheaper flight with connecting JetBlue flights through BOS and JFK. Big mistake. I should have paid the premium for an Emirates only booking and completely avoid JetBlue. Flight staff have the friendliness but incompetence of high school interns. Weather delay I understand. I drove through the rainstorm. At the check-in counter, I specifically asked the staff at the counter if I would make my connecting flight to Emirates in BOS. He responded that the connection was tight but good. Wrong. At the gate, just before boarding, I and four other people were informed that we would miss our connections, and needed interline tickets. The staff at the gate spent an hour on the phone getting interline tickets for the other four passengers, and when she got to me, then after another twenty minutes on the phone, she informed me that I had just missed an interline ticket with Qatar Airways by fifteen minutes, and could only go the next day - a loss of 24 hours for me. She talked to me in the nicest department store customer service voice, but was incompetent. I missed a whole day on my vacation. JetBlue should have booked the interline ticket immediately at the check-in counter when they had told me that the connection to my Emirates flight out of BOS was tight. Returning connection JFK to IAD. I landed at JFK timely with Emirates, and put my checked bag on the connections check-in counter, and proceeded to JetBlue Terminal. I saw on the Departures Board that my connecting JetBlue flight from JFK to IAD was several hours away, but that there was an earlier JetBlue flight. I asked the staff at the Help Desk if I could get a boarding pass for the earlier flight. He asked me if I had a checked bag, and I replied that I already had checked in my bag at the transfer connecting flights counter. And so then he said that ""no"" I couldn't get an earlier flight because my bag was already checked in for the later flight and was going to be on that flight. Okay, fine. I understand. So I took my originally booked flight, my first actual flight on a JetBlue aircraft, which took off about two hours late (being a small discount aircraft flight at the very end of the day, I kind of understand that.) Upon arrival at IAD, I looked and looked for my checked bag at Carousel 10. After many bags went by, I looked around the carousel, and saw my bag sitting inside the JetBlue baggage office. It had come on the earlier flight! So here I am at Dulles at two o'clock in the morning with my bag, calling for my pickup ride, when I could have been calling for my pickup ride at a more civilized hour in the early evening! I specifically asked the staff at the gate if food would be provided onboard the aircraft. I was told ""no."" So I stocked up on some snacks at the nearby snack kiosk.

I asked for clarification-you are telling me to pay to travel to the airport where you have already notified me that my flight is canceled to possibly offer me compensation. Yes the rep offers. I am horrified - what if this was my daughter flying. What would she do in a city by herself without a hotel? I checked the website and entered my flight info - no compensation. Thankfully I did not spend $60 getting to the airport to learn this. Unacceptable.,,Business,Economy Class,Boston to Philedelphia,July 2017,1,1,,,1,1,no
Jetblue Airways,1,Glen Pankhurst,15th July 2017,"✅ Verified Review | New York to Seattle. The incompetence and lack of ownership from JetBlue's side astounds me. I am unlikely to ever fly this airline again. From my flight being cancelled (Flight 263), to them loosing my luggage and blaming everyone else (Emirates, Me, Customs, etc) but themselves, to their inundated Customer Service people spending 30 to 60 minutes on the phone per customer to attempt to get them on other flights. I spent almost 6 hours at JFK figuring out what I needed to do as their customer service representatives were so unhelpful and made almost no announcements to anyone to let us know what was actually going on. I stood in one line for 2 hours and then another for another 2 hours and at no point were we given any clear guidance as to what was actually happening. Once I finally got a ticket out of New York for 2 days after the cancelled flight, I was told that JetBlue would not cover accommodation due to the flight being cancelled on account on bad weather. There was no bad weather in New York at the time that we arrived or the time the flight was supposed to depart. I spoke to several passengers who were all going to very different destinations, Seattle, Charleston, Boston, etc and all flights were cancelled which tells me that the weather issue was not the destination or on route, it was the source (New York), and seeing that there was actually no rain an just some clouds, it seems ludicrous that they would have us believe that the flights were cancelled due to bad weather. The fact that these sorts of things must happen every day, so for me to spend 6 hours in a airport, sorting everything from flights, to accommodation, to taxis, to my lost luggage which up to today no one had logged a ticket for, is absolutely unacceptable and it boggles my mind that they are still operating with this level of inefficiency, lack of procedure and incompetence.",,Business,Economy Class,New York to Seattle,July 2017,,,,,1,1,no

Flight has been delayed due to ""weather conditions"" and finally canceled - and we have been rebooked to connecting flights via JFK, so will spend whole day flying. No compensation. Killed Saturday. The irony is there were many flights same day which successfully taken off from Boston and landed in Nantucket same time with canceled JB flight. Not been stopped by weather. Looks like when you are JetBlue and have a lot of free seats next day on others flights, nothing prevents to cancel a flight and save a lot of money - no matter what plans people have.

For some reason, my son was not able to travel with me, but I still kept the ticket and checked in for him. Since I paid for the ticket, I wanted to keep the seat vacant for more space. When I was boarding at the gate, Jetblue staff took my son's boarding pass away from me. She said that since my son was not boarding, Jetblue needed to have the boarding pass back, and to remove my son from the flight customer list. I asked if Jetblue would give the seat to the others. The Jetblue staff said that they can and that's how it work. I was surprised of the information.

I was supposed to go home on June 30th at 10:30 pm out of JFK, but that did not happen. My flight was delayed for hours, until, they finally cancelled it. Not only did the support team have no remorse or sympathy, the only flight they could get me on was the next day at 8 am, which had a 5 hour layover in Boston and wouldn't get to Buffalo until the next day at 8 pm. I had no guarantee I would not get stuck in Boston the next day. My trip was cancelled, I was stranded at New York JFK at 3 in the morning, with no way to get home but spend $100 on an Uber back to my home in Jersey. I was inconvenienced, exhausted, and upset. I waited in the customer service line for two hours, only for their support team to tell me they could not refund me. I was finally refunded the next day after waiting on hold for an hour. It was not weather - it was that this airline could not handle the magnitude of flights booked for the Holiday Weekend and did not have enough Pilots. Maybe if the customer service team was a bit more caring, efficient and helpful, I would consider flying with Jet Blue, but not even one ounce of remorse or care-that shows me how valued we are as customers.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Buffalo via Boston,June 2017,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Jetblue Airways,1,H Nelson,30th June 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Based on my experiences of 6/22/2017 and 6/24/2017 I will never purchase another fare from JetBlue and I will never recommend them to anyone. In the spring I began making plans to attend my daughters graduation from grad school in Vermont. Using Expedia, I searched for a reasonable fare and decided on JetBlue. The fares I purchased included a flight from O'Hare to JFK with a short layover at JFK and then a flight to Vermont. The same package in reverse was available for us three days later when we wanted to return home. So in all I purchased three fares, one for myself, my husband and youngest daughter and altogether, we were scheduled for two flights to get to Vermont and two flights to return to Chicago. On the drive into O'Hare on the morning of 6/22/2017 I received a text message that the flight to JFK and then the connecting flight to Vermont had been cancelled. There was no reasonable explanation given. Here were all my hopes of getting to Vermont cancelled in a brief, cold text message. I called Expedia who helped me arrange for another flight to Burlington but they also told me to keep the flight with JetBlue for my return flight on 6/24/2017 as they hadn't cancelled those two flights. Bad idea. I should of cancelled it and made changes right then but I thought this kind of event was something unusual. On Saturday 6/24/2017 when we went to the airport in Vermont to depart, the JetBlue flight was delayed for around four hours. JetBlue arranged for us to get a later connecting flight to Chicago that was suppose to leave around 6.00. When we got to JFK, the flight to Chicago was on the board and it said ""on time"". I think we may have been there an hour or so and suddenly the status of the flight was changed to ""cancelled"". Again, we got no answers or help from JetBlue's customer service with the exception of telling us where we could pick up our checked bag in the airport and rescheduling a plane the next day that we later learned would supposedly leave some time around 2.00 in afternoon and get us home by 9.30 after two connecting flights. Fearing we would be stranded in yet another city we made other arrangements. Essentially, we were left stranded at JFK by JetBlue. There were no available hotel rooms this weekend as it was Pride weekend in New York City and all the hotels were booked. We searched for rooms, Expedia searched for us and after using the services at JFK we learned there was nothing available. We were given no help or direction from JetBlue that was meaningful or helpful in our situation. We had never been to New York and only expected our stay to be a brief one as a connecting flight. No room, no reciprocity with another carrier. So to be clear, three out of the four flights we had arranged months in advance were cancelled by JetBlue with just the flick of a text message. I will never fly JetBlue ever again. I am utterly appalled for what passed as service and the willingness to leave people stranded with no assistance. There are few words to describe the service we received from JetBlue over this weekend but it was punctuated with an attitude of ""aww too bad"" and your on your own. I would like to thank the people who did help us at JFK but they were were from a different carrier, who actually got us home the next morning.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago O'Hare to Vermont via JFK,June 2017,1,3,3,1,1,1,no

Jetblue Airways,1,John Sherwood,27th May 2017,"✅ Verified Review | Thought that I'd try Jetblue for the first time when they posted the cheapest flight for the first time in the 3 years I've been flying between San Antonio / Austin and New York. In the end I've come to the conclusion, as I'm waiting overnight in the JFK terminal for 8 hours that they really just don't care. I originally scheduled travel to leave on the evening of 25 May but I was informed that the flight would be delayed out of Austin for 3 hrs and as a result would miss my connection at JFK. The earliest they'd be able to get me out of JFK on the 26th would be 4pm, so I changed my flight to depart Austin on the 26th. The same flight on the 26th was again delayed from 5:06pm to 5:50 pm and I called to ensure that I would still make my connection. The phone agent confirmed I would make the connection so I drove to Austin to catch my flight. While waiting at the gate the flight was delayed again, now to 6:25pm. Attendant at the gate confirmed that I would make my connection. As I was boarding the plane I was told that I'd have to check my carry-on. I explained that I had a tight connection in JFK, but was reassured by the gate that it wouldn't be a problem. As we approached JFK the flight had to circle until we were diverted to refuel in Philly for return to JFK. Once we finally landed at JFK it was 12:30am and thought I would have time to catch my connecting flight however, no one from Jetblue met the plane and the crew did not provide connection information. I looked at the departure boards but my flight was not listed. As I attempted in vain to search the gates for my departing flight and access the flight status option on the website (which did not work) I went to the previous gate I was told the flight would be at before it had been delayed several times, but it was not there and the only manned ""Just Ask"" station in the terminal was in close proximity but with twenty people in line. So I called the 1-800 number and it was obvious that the phone agent was not well trained and tried to inform me that my next flight was my departure flight on the 29th and all my previous flights had departed on time. She had no idea that my flights had been delayed and informed me that the only available flight was 8:36am that morning. I asked then why had I received texts that my connecting flight was not departing until 01:07am and she couldn't explain it but asked if I wanted to change my flight as if I had a choice. When I said yes, she stated that she would have to get a supervisor to allow her to make the change. That process took about 30 minutes and at the conclusion she told me that I needed to talk to an employee at the terminal to confirm the information she'd provided me. When I finally got to the front I was told that the flight had indeed been delayed and that I could have caught that flight and my bag had made it on the flight. Why wouldn't the flight be on the departure screens? So now I have no access to my bag during the 8 hour layover. To top it off, I requested to talk to a supervisor and was told that someone would come talk to me but it could take a while, I have 8 hours to spend here anyway so said sure I'll wait. Two hours later I was told that the supervisor would not be able to speak with me and that if I truly wanted to speak with one that I would need to exit security and search for one at the ticket counter.

Jetblue Airways,1,Kristen Greene,15th May 2017,✅ Verified Review | Boston to New York. I am so disappointed by my experience with JetBlue from two weeks ago. After sitting on the plane on the runway for an hour we were all told to exit the plane and wait in a very long line to figure out how to fix our travel plans. There were about 5 of us traveling to Honolulu who got completely screwed because we missed our connecting flight. The only option for us was to wait 12 hours for a flight to Vegas > Honolulu then a 3 hour delay before finally flying to Lihue for me. This means I missed my first night in my hotel. I was 14 hours late to my final destination. I missed my shuttle and had to pay for a taxi which was ridiculously expensive. When I wrote to JetBlue they refused to reimburse me for anything and gave me a $50 credit. You can't fly anywhere for $50.

Jetblue Airways,4,D Gargano,10th May 2017,"✅ Verified Review | New York to Las Vegas. We were to fly out of New York May 5th, but they canceled our flight. I understand weather and such, but delay it would have been better. I called customer service to the tune of I am sorry, nothing we can do. We had a show that was paid for months ago and important to get to Las Vegas before 8pm. They could only get us on a 6-7pm flight which put us into LV after the show had started. Considering airlines were flying out in the afternoon, when the weather was better, JetBlue could not even accommodate by adding a flight that would have helped many of us who had to scramble for another airline. Every airline we checked was full or flying out in the evening. You could imagine how upset I was. JetBlue has a high cancellation record and I have been flying with them since the beginning. Dealing with TV's that haven't worked to sometimes unfriendly crew members, I brushed it off. When customer service on the phone says this has happened to them and they didn't take it out on the person trying to help them, after asking them how would they feel if this happen to them? That was wrong. Flying home on JetBlue was terrible. Full flight and the TV's did not work. It was a new plane and they did not work. Crew was not that friendly, empty cups and soda bottles were left under the seats. I feel like they have overgrown. No regard for the inconvenience of their passengers who have to shell out hundreds more dollars for a flight with another carrier or who miss important events. If you cancel a flight, figure out rescheduling a little later. That is the right thing to do. Put another airplane into use with a crew. I will tell you, we flew out on Delta and I was very impressed. I have 2 more trips on JetBlue coming up and then I think I need to part ways. I felt at their mercy like they shrugged their shoulders. I have choices and they should understand that. Sometimes the lower fare is not the best choice. I have written them many times on their great service and flights. Now I can't say that. They price gauge for everything from seating room, $70 for more legroom and the seats are not much more comfortable. At least on Delta, seats are wider and more comfortable for an up charge. This put us out almost $500 that we did not expect to spend. Everyone has their opinion and experience with each airline.

Jetblue Airways,10,Tony Spitale,1st May 2017,"✅ Verified Review | The only criteria to book my connecting flight from Boston to JFK on this airline was the very convenient departure time. I had not flown on this airline before nor did I have any idea what I was going to expect. From entering the Terminal C in Boston until leaving the dedicated Terminal in JFK it was a unique and breathtaking experience. When I approached the self-check-in kiosks at Logan a smartly dressed employee came up to me and assisted me through the entire process. The whole check-in area had more the appearance of an After-work-lounge than an airport facility. Everything looked so classy, like out of some Hollywood movie. There were no lines at security and I was through in a breeze. Doors were closed on time. The seats on the small Embraer jet were comfortable, even for me as a tall guy. I took advantage of the live television broadcast on the individual screens and caught up with the latest political and weather news. There was a 30-minute-departure delay out of Boston but we reached the gate at JFK right on time. In-between the young and enthusiastic crew served softdrinks and snacks of high quality.

This is ridiculous we had 3 paid seats which they gave away for a minute delay we could have easily made to the gate on time if the agent had shown a little care and checked us in. When I called the customer service center to report this issue they were not helpful and said there was nothing they could do. I am returning home and waiting to go back to airport for a 6:40 pm flight, enough of my issue a word of advice to whoever is flying and running a little bit behind make sure to take a few minutes to do online check-in so you can ensure that you are checked in 40 minute prior and then as needed print your tickets at kiosk.

Today I should be on the spring break vacation with the young children and teenage nieces that I have been planning for 6 weeks. Due to a cancellation and no rebooking availability on Jetblue, I sit at home writing this oh so very true review. There are no considerable hotels available within driving distance. Thus, there is very little we can do at this point to overcome the disappoint our family is encountering. After two hours and getting no where with Jetblue, I am simultaneously attempting to cancel all other accommodations arranged for this trip. I am highly discouraged by this airline's lack of treatment to its patrons. Customer service under provided when it could have chosen to be highlighted as unforgettably amazing! Jetblue better step up its CS game or face serious future consequences. Empower your employees to do want is right in extenuating circumstances. We are people not systems. Southwest here we come again, gave JB straight one star because I wouldn't know - never boarded the flight and couldn't be rebooked for another.

Jetblue Airways,1,Allen Miller,10th April 2017,"✅ Verified Review | New York JFK to Los Angeles, Whereas I've often seen that when a couple of family comes aboard separated they will sit together and when someone comes who has the seat they all work it out - with my volume of travel, and my teams', we're often those people who switch our seat, here's how JetBlue made this mess. There were no adjacent tickets available for purchase when we bought the tix so we ended up with two mint window seats and two aisle seats, each set on opposite sides of the aisle, my 11 year old son sat on his own but of course we couldn't leave my 7 year old little girl sitting alone by a window seat while my wife sat on the other side of the aisle without even full view of my daughter and have some stranger sit next to my little girl. So my wife sat next to my little girl until we could talk to the person in that seat - who we assumed would be reasonable like the rest of us. Then one of the gate staff came in and told my wife she had to move, leave my 7 year old little girl who still carries her pink blanket with her alone. I went up and told them there was no way we were leaving our little girl alone in that seat, wait for some stranger to sit there and hope the airline could work it out. The guy across the aisle was sweet amidst what was becoming a tense situation and offered to trade, which was great. I then went up to tell the pilot, stewardess and offending gate person that I was going to issue a formal complaint and rather than simply apologizing or even just saying something like ""I understand of course, go ahead"" he threatened to have our family wait for the next flight if I complained. I was speechless and since my wife and my daughter were now sitting together safely I let it go. Do they train these airline people on customer service and service recovery at all?

JetBlue Airways attracts it's customers with low prices for airfare as well as complimentary items such as their free 36 Direct TV channels on their in flight entertainment systems. However, while complimentary items and low airfare are nice, the customer service always needs to be a priority and that is what was lacking on Flight 602 service to Boston. Even though this was a Red-eye flight (aka an all-nighter), I believe that at the least flight attendants shouldn't be screaming for people to sit down. The attendants on this flight I can imagine probably don't like their shift but taking it out on the passengers isn't right. And while I understand that they have a tight schedule to keep they are perfectly capable of saying please and thank you every once in a while. All I have to say is that if you think low airfare and complimentary items beats Customer Service in the airline industry, then Jetblue Airways isn't so bad - but personally I prefer an airline with good customer service.",A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Boston,January 2017,2,1,2,5,1,3,no

Afterwards we were called and assigned seats on Even More Space right behind L2. Flight attendants were extremely courteous and offered me a free snack box which was absolutely delicious.

OK, it was really a short round trip between Boston and New York (40 to 45 minutes each way), but from experience, this does not mean unpleasant surprises can't happen. The flight out was a new route to LaGuardia so the passengers even got a free morning snack (bagel with some jam). Unlike most airlines, Jetblue did not threaten people forcing them to surrender their cabin baggage, but instead asked for a specific number of volunteers. Our flight back was at 11pm, but we arrived earlier, and it turns out that Jetblue can try to put you on an earlier flight for free (if it's just one flight earlier). They managed to fit us on a flight one hour earlier. Both flights were on time despite going between very busy airports, and since the allotted time takes into consideration possible delays, we arrived earlier than scheduled in both times. The best part is how organized Jetblue flights are. From a boarding procedure that, like in APAC, fills the back rows first so that long queues don't get stuck behind, to the way they distribute drinks (ask first, then only bring what's needed instead of pushing the trolley for half an hour).",E190 / A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,BOS to LGA,November 2016,5,5,5,3,5,5,yes

Jetblue's A320 has the most comfortable seating in economy that I have been in and at 6' 4"" and 300 pounds that is a very positive thing. Unfortunately, that is about the only positive. Fares were reasonable but the absurd $55 for two bags and $20 for one is a pure ripoff. They provided nothing except soft drinks/juice on the flight, the snacks were tiny and even the overpriced food they were pushing looked like something out of a nightmare. It seems to me that with fuel prices half what they were a couple of years ago, completely booked flights and charging for every amenity they could be a bit more generous.

One of the pilots came over so he could board the plane. He received no assistance. After waiting a few minutes. He walked up to the agent and proceeded to ask why he wasn't helping the man who was still waiting at the desk. The pilot walked away looking frustrated. The agent proceeded to turn back to his conversation leaving the customer still waiting at the desk. Eventually, the agent started to walk away from the woman he'd been talking to when the husband stepped up and entered the conversation. At that point I walked up to him, excused myself, and ask if there was anyone working the desk. He said yes and I proceeded to ask when they would be coming. He hesitated for a moment before identifying himself as said attendant. He finally asked what my needs were. The man at the attendant station still stood unhelped with a look of aggregation on his face. The agent asked us to wait, saying he'd be right back, as he walked to the desk. We followed behind him just in case he got distracted again. The first customer's frustration grew based on his look of discuss at having been completely overlooked.

Jetblue Airways,10,J Lane,7th November 2016,"✅ Verified Review | Syracuse to Fort Lauderdale. All-around great experience with Jetblue Airways! At the airport, the ground crew were excellent. Booked a 'Need more Space' seat. It was comfortable and spacious (row 1). Flight crew was amazing and the luggage came off quickly. Plane was not new, but relatively clean. All TVs functioned well. Free 'Flyfi' was a great bonus! My only complaint might be that the tray table, which came up out of the arm and was hinged in the middle, was bent so it was difficult to put a beverage on and remain confident that it would not end up in my lap.

However, it was easy and quick which made the early morning flight a breeze. Boarding (row by row) however, became a little complicated as the announcer didn't speak clearly. It was a 5 hour flight and although you have to pay for refreshments (no cash accepted) they provided 2 complimentary (soft and hot) drinks and snack service.

I am always shopping around to save. I have tried other airlines and in the end Jetblue always turns out to be a better experience. The planes are roomy, there is a TV for everyone and you end up saving more than with other airlines. Other airlines try to get you with a cheaper ticket and then over charge you for carry-on. With Jetblue your carry on is free and checked baggage fees are not too high. They always offer you a drink and a snack for your trip.

Today September 4th I was traveling as a standby passenger and got booted off after boarding the plane. Due to weight restrictions and excess luggage issues. Another passenger volunteered to exit the plane so that I could make the flight. He did in fact deplane along with his wife and daughter. I was still asked to leave because of luggage problems. I then waited 2 hours for it to be returned to me. Then I was told that one piece of luggage was left back on the plane. So I was asked to deplane because of weight and luggage issues yet my suitcase left without me. Bravo jetblue.

Perhaps the age of the plane varies, thus the seat designs change, but overall it’s a predictable formula which I very much appreciate in the US. This was a 4.5 hour flight, so quite long. We paid for extra legroom, which to me makes all the difference. Was worth it. I didn’t eat throughout the flight, but got plenty of water and was on the wifi the whole time which worked very well.

But in the last month I have had nothing but delayed and canceled flights. I'm not sure if it is a management problem but they seem to never be able to keep their schedule. I have flown three times in the last month and all three time I have had over two hour delays, 7/13, 8/5 and now again 8/18. To make it worse they never have a reason. Once I was told it was because of bad weather in Orlando where the plane was coming from but when I checked the weather in Orlando it was perfect with 10% chance of rain. My flight is a 25 minute flight from San Juan to St. Croix and it seems to always be delayed for hours. That just doesn't make sense. I'm waiting 8 times longer than my flight time.

We were given no other information. The jetblue staff refused to help anyone. They made us go back to the check in desk to get on another flight. So after making us sit 10 hrs for a cancelled flight, we were expected to stand in line for another few hours to get a flight. I walked to the front of the line and demanded help. The first lady rude and dismissive, finally I walked over to another lady and I just lost it and had a full on panic attack in front if the whole airport. Finally she got me tickets. There was not a flight until two days later. I was refused any kind of hotel accommodation because it was due to ""weather"". We had to spend money on taxi services to go back and forth from a relative's apartment that we were staying with. If I hadn't had a relative in the city their only other suggestion would be to sleep on a cot for the next two days in the airport. We were never offered any kind of food or drink voucher.

The flight was delayed by more than 2:45 minutes and of course we were not extended the courtesy of being informed of this as we were checking in baggage. It was only realized as we approached the gate where we encountered hundreds of angry passengers. There was zero communication. We were told to stand in the line containing hundreds of people if we wanted to make other arrangements. Needless to say after standing there for over an hour only to watch the line shorten by 1 person I had had enough. I called the 800 number where I was informed they could book me on the next days flight but they couldn't tell me where, how, or what to do about my luggage. Had they told me upon the time I was checking in my luggage I could have made the decision as to what to do at that moment but to mislead me, take my money, and send me upstairs to what they knew was a nightmare was far more unprofessional.

He brings my coffee and I say thank you, loudly. He says nothing so I say thank you once more as he hands me my ice, no response. My husband who was sleeping even heard me thank him.

During the one hour layover, the boarding gate changed three times, from E8 to E6 to E10. After changing gates multiple times, we find out that the flight actually departed from E8 and we missed our flight. They did not call our names over loudspeaker because they didn't even know our names or know that we were missing from the flight.

After security we went to our original gate, where we realized it was changed to 11. When we arrived at our new gate boarding already began. As we were walking in, my wife made a humorous comment about the gate change. It was then that one of the JetBlue staff members rudely interrupted our conversation to chime in, ""you know gates do change and you are responsible to know about these changes"". Upon boarding, we were shocked to see that our overhead storage compartment was completely taken. We had paid extra money to receive the ""extra legroom seats"" and we were seated in row 1. It appeared that all of the passengers seated behind us had placed their luggage in the first 6 rows of overhead compartments. I decided to take a seat and wait for everyone to be seated so I could walk to the back of the plane to place my bags, this seemed like the only option being that my wife and I had two carry on bags with absolutely no free compartments in sight. It was here where one of the flight attendants came up to me and said ""sir you cannot have your bags in front of you"". I kindly told her that there was no space in any compartments near me, she said you need to go to the back of the plane and ""find space"". Have paid extra for the ""even more space"" seat and paying to sit in row 1, I was flabbergasted when we asked the flight attendant for a blanket for my pregnant wife and she responded with ""that's $5 dollars, how will you pay?"". It was about 30 minutes into the flight when the flight attendant came through with water and asked what drinks we would like. I requested for a Ginger ale and the flight attendant wrote it down. It was 42 minutes to be exact before I received my wife's drink. I asked the flight attendant twice about the drink.

Jetblue Airways,1,H Bieher,9th April 2016,"✅ Verified Review | Washington Dulles to New York JFK with Jetblue. This was probably one of the worst experiences I had in over 20 years of regular flying. From the beginning till the very end. We experienced a delay due to weather conditions. However, the ground staff was not helpful at all. A lot of us had connecting flights, and we asked that they contact the airlines we were flying with to check the status. They refused. We asked that they give us the telephone numbers of the airline so that we, the passengers, can contact them. They refused. And as the wifi was not working in the terminal, it was difficult to get the numbers. We got it, despite the refusal of the JetBlue staff. We asked to be rerouted to other airlines who were taking off. They refused. We had over 6 hours delay, and as they refused to contact the connecting international airlines, we missed (9 of us) the connection by few minutes. And then, the real nightmare started. In JFK, they were incapable of locating our luggage. It took them hours to tell us that finally, they can't locate it and we need to come back the next day. As there were no seats available on my connecting flight for few days, I needed to get my luggage. And when we were trying to rebook, the people standing at the counters would not take us, as 'they had to be free for first class passengers, in case they came, so they could not serve us'. For a low cost airline, this sounds like a joke. The result was a long queue before one of the counter, and at the other, the woman starring and not accepting any passenger. After 6:30 hours delay and additional 3 hours of trying to figure out what to do, this was a particularly bad experience. The next day, they were incapable of saying where the luggage is. I lost the whole day until I finally got my luggage. I heard all type of excuses: as my luggage was initially checked through to the final destination, it was difficult to locate it (do they know how t use bar codes?), or it was not clear where the luggage was, etc. I finally got my luggage thanks to the assistance from the other airline, who tried to help, as JetBlue was incapable. But they clearly said that this was a JetBlue problem. I also asked JetBlue to give me a confirmation about the delay, so that my insurance can assist me. They refused. They said that my insurance (from Europe) had to call the 0800 number to get a confirmation. But they are not providing a confirmation. I spoke to not less than 4 different people, including the one claiming to be the supervisor, they refused. Throughout the whole nightmare, the one thing that they kept saying consistently was 'I cannot', 'I don't know', 'It is not JetBlue's problem', 'it is not possible'. There was no customer service, no desire to help, no desire to find a solution whatsoever, from pretty much everybody working at this company. The result of all this is: I will never ever fly with JetBlue.

This was perplexing, as I happened to be leaving Boston at the same time as friends flying different airlines — none of their flights were canceled. When I called customer service, I was told that the cancellation was due to weather, and that 'all the other airlines would be canceling their flights in the morning' as well. I was initially told that my only option was to take the next JetBlue flight out of Boston at approx. 1.30pm. I was then told that flight was full, my remaining option was to take a Wednesday flight, staying two additional nights in Boston at my own expense. I asked to be rebooked on another airline, and was told I would have to rebook it myself. I was offered a refund, which the representative later clarified would be only a half refund. I rebooked with American for a flight leaving at 8.00am, a mere 40 minutes ahead of my original JetBlue flight. Surprise, surprise, it left perfectly on time. Unfortunately, my new one-way ticket cost more than my original roundtrip with JetBlue. In situations such as this, JetBlue is unable to provide a comparable level of service as other airlines. They have a practice of preemptively canceling flights, especially those flights which are not full in an effort to control *potential* delays in other parts of the country. If I hadn’t had access to internet in order to rebook immediately, I would likely still be in Boston. It I hadn’t had the available funds to rebook at my own expense, I would still be in Boston without any place to stay. I must add however, that since returning home Jetblue has offered to reimburse me for the entirety of the rebooked ticket.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BOS to RDU,April 2016,1,1,,,1,1,no

Free drinks and snacks, and if your -kid needs two bags of chips, no problem. Upgrades when they can. I had told the woman at the ticket counter that me and my kids were in the last row going to Florida. She took my tickets and told me to check back in an hour with her.

The planes were clean, the service was great;, the food/snacks were good. On transcontinental. flights there was a good film selection. There was an air of humor and intelligence to the way the material for passengers was written. The plane I and my husband just flew on was dingy. The staff was trying hard, but they seemed to be struggling with their own problems. The food was terrible; no complimentary food for premium economy. And the film selection was dreadful.

My option for a replacement flight is in 2 days - a 3:00am flight into a different airport an hour away from my original destination. In order to salvage my family's spring break vacation (my children's Easter gift) in Long Beach, I offered to drive the 12-15 hours today from Salt Lake to Long Beach if they could comp or reduce my original return flight home in order to help cover the costs of a rental car and drop fee I'd have to pay, not to mention we would lose a day of our our vacation by driving. No dice! They offered no solutions to essentially killing my family's vacation. They were unreasonable in helping me to rectify the problem and unsympathetic to non-refundable hotel costs their screw-up has cost me.

Jetblue realised this problem, and put me on the earlier flight to Boston instead, which had more seats.

The airline has started to outfit their planes with new seats and better inflight entertainment screens. The food service amounts to chips and cookies, but again, it's a budget airline so they serve food accordingly. Recently they have started to charge for baggage but if you book online they do offer a better rate than most other airlines that charge. Furthermore, you can see some of the improvements (as previously mentioned, newer seats and better inflight entertainment screens).

The additional space in regular economy made more than a difference than I thought. The flight crew was courteous and helpful and complimentary snack selection is better than other domestic airlines. I liked that the flight attendants didn't walk up down the aisle with carts - it allows them to get through so much faster and doesn't trap people in the aisle when they're trying to go to the restroom.

Flight departed and arrived on time. In plane they have much wider choice of snacks plus you can ask for as many packages as you wish, same with sodas. All seats had small screens and I was able to watch TV channels for free.

Jetblue is known for higher quality service so I was expecting a good experience. Not so. The flight itself was ok, with great legroom and seats. On the way up, the weather was horrible in Boston so we were stuck in Baltimore for six hours. Lunch vouchers of 10 dollars were distributed along with snacks. I don't blame them for the delay totally, but it did contribute to my attitude towards Jetblue on the return flight. The flight up was cold even though it was winter. They decided that AC was a good idea during winter. ""Great idea"". Snacks were good though. On the return flight, we were scheduled for a nice afternoon/evening flight, but Jetblue decided to take our plane away from us, fly it to JFK for another flight which they thought was more important than ours, and left us sitting in the terminal for 3-4 more hours. What a bad experience. We met and chatted with some people to pass time which was entertaining but did not compensate for the time lost. We got home at 11:30 p.m. when we were supposed to get home at 7 or so. What was even worse was that the plane was even colder than the last flight.

I was told I would get some sort of compensation but I registered on the website to check and I got nothing. Very disappointing, but at least they didn't leave my suitcase a complete mess. The flight itself was ok. If it weren't for the luggage issue I'd probably have more positive things to say but I feel like I got royally screwed over.

I have to recognize that flight attendants are helpful, attentive and approachable; captain made at least four announcements during taxi and in flight regarding ETA. Entertainment on the plane also was great and provided plenty of options even for a flight this short. It is a pity that the superb service on the plane did little to offset my initial impression after security check and before boarding. The flight arrived into IAD just in time for me to run from opposite ends in IAD terminals to catch an overnight connecting flight, luckily I had only a carry on and no terminal change was required. The thing is I left with the impression that the airline did little to expedite our boarding process (could have anticipated boarding for 15 or so minutes at least), showing no care for its passengers time gate.

The interiors of the aircraft were old and tired looking, the seats were hard and rigid with the smallest of recline, even in “Extra Space”, an interior upgrade would be good. Paying $20.00 for a checked bag seems somewhat counterproductive. At the gate the ground crew was asking people to check bags in for free because the fights were full.

Jetblue Airways,10,Sarah Kramer,15th November 2015,"On our way back home from the Dominican Republic our plane to New York was delayed about 6 hours. When we first heard this we were so upset because they only have one plane that comes into that small airport but they quickly worked out a plan to get us home. They were going to put us in a hotel overnight in New York but I am a critical care nurse and could not miss any more days of work. Right when they heard this they switched our connecting flight and even changed our destination from San Diego to LAX. They comped our taxi ride, gave us food vouchers and even a coupon for our next flight with them. They made a very stressful situation run so smoothly. They lady at the desk in LAX knew how to be patient with people. She was so helpful and sweet. We will for sure be flying with Jetblue on future flights!",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Puerto Plata to San Diego,November 2015,4,4,4,5,5,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,1,Aaron Cremer,11th November 2015,"This is a low cost airline who I thought were a little different from the rest, unfortunately not. I wanted to change a flight and instead of charging me the current difference in price they wanted to look back at the price I paid for the fare and the price now. If they said we will charge you the difference in airfare at the time of booking then fine, but they wanted to charge the difference of a fare booked weeks in advance, hence cheaper, and the cost of the new flight which departed in 24 hours. The flight I was booked on was exactly the same cost as the one I wanted to change to, but these cowboys wanted to basically steal money from me to get something that was of exactly the same value. Small airline generally stay just that, because they haven't the foresight or sense of customer satisfaction the market leaders have. When I asked to be put through to their customer service department I was told the person I was speaking to was it! Rude abrupt and totally devoid of any sense of what is right and unwilling to help. All I got was ""it is in the terms and conditions"" which very few of us read but do expect like all good companies are reasonable and fair.",,Business,Economy Class,New York to Nassau,November 2015,3,2,1,1,2,1,no

The flight left on time and arrived early into Las Vegas. I had no issue with the flight or service. Monday night football was on, which many were enjoying on their IFE, and the game literally ended as we pulled up to the gate, the timing could not have been better. JetBlue does charge for bags which I paid. And from the time I booked the flight to the time I left the price of the flight only went up (as it should).",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,FLL to LAS,November 2015,4,4,3,4,4,5,yes

They had seatback TVs, that played around 35 channels. The flight attendants weren't very interesting. Served soda and snacks, including peanuts, chips and cookies. Good service overall. Bumpy though, because there was a storm over Cape Cod.

Jetblue Airways,10,Bojan Tercon,28th October 2015,"First time on JetBlue and I can now see what the fuss is about. They're excellent. We paid extra for the 'Even More space' seats and it was worth it. Never have had so much leg room on an economy class seat - which is important on this 4.30 hour flight from New York to Aruba. The service was great, the IFE system fantastic and the A321 plane was close to new. The internet worked for part of the flight and was quite fast for being airborne (it only works over US air space - although would be great if it worked for the entire duration of the flight). The only improvement required is the food menu. On such a long flight they should have something more substantial to eat than a processed cheese pack or pretzels.",A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Aruba,October 2015,5,5,2,5,5,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,9,Steve Parkin,26th October 2015,"I must admit, as a UK resident, I had had some dread about using Jetblue, as I had expected they would be a US equivalent of Ryanair. However, they turned out to be just fine. Booked online weeks in advance, checked in at the airport, all very quick and efficient, flights exactly on time. Big seats and legroom, more than on the international flights we took. I'll give them a 9 even though they left my case in San Francisco (the airport's fault, not theirs), as they got it into the hotel in Las Vegas the same night and provided e-mail updates several times during the process. Really surprised by how nice it was to fly with them.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SFO to LVG via LBO,October 2015,5,5,3,,5,4,yes
Jetblue Airways,1,Victoria Sutton,21st October 2015,"The flight from New York to Las Vegas was fine. Nothing special, but nothing horrible. My real problem with Jetblue was regarding my flight home. I had a flight booked from Las Vegas back to New York on a Sunday night at 9:15 pm. At around 6:00 pm, on that Sunday, I received an email not from Jetblue but from expedia, the site I used to book the flight. The email said that Jetblue had made changes to my flight, without even notifying me themselves! I was told by expedia to call them right away, and was told that my flight was canceled. Expedia tried to get me on another flight that night, Expedia not the airline of which I was a customer! Expedia informed me that Jetblue had no other fights that night, and I would have to fly out in the afternoon the next day. I could not do that, I had no money to spend on another hotel stay for the night, I was already checked out of my previous hotel, and ready to go home. I thought in the least, Jetblue would accommodate me with a free hotel stay for the night, but they were not accommodating in any way whatsoever. They did not reassure me that they would at least try to get me back on another flight that night, no hotel stay, nothing! Luckily, some friends I was with managed to get us a flight that night on Virgin America. But Jetblue had no compassion, were completely uncaring towards me, and my two other friends who were on that same canceled flight. I was told with much attitude, to calm down over the phone multiple times. They were also completely useless when my parents called them from New York, trying to fix my situation. That is no way to treat a customer. I am never flying with Jetblue again.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Las Vegas,October 2015,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

The agent said ""they will assign her a seat at the gate"". Totally confused about that we checked everything in and when we got to the gate we explained to the agent for some reason one of us didn't get a seat assignment. We then asked if we could be reassigned to sit together. They first offered us the last seats on the plane, we didn't want those if we didn't have too. After about 5 minutes we had seats in the extra room section. Very pleased with our area lots of room. Our interaction with 2 flight attendants was outstanding and made the flight a delight.

Jetblue Airways,8,Chris Hann,22nd September 2015,"I paid the extra $70 to upgrade to an even more room. To me it was well worth it because I had to book late and the alternative was a seat in the middle of a row down the back. For the money you get loads of leg room, actually plenty for a tall man, and you get to sit right up front. At boarding you are one of the first on so you don't have to fight for bin space. I was in 2F so I didn't have far to walk. JetBlue offers free WiFi which you can use for normal access, but you can't download large files unless you want to spend more on the upgraded service. All I wanted was to be able to send progress messages. It worked for that but it wasn't particularly fast. I had a look at the free entertainment, but to me it was rubbish. Just the usual low brow low life shows I wouldn't watch on TV. This is why I don't have cable TV any more. Alaska is a lot better. Food is snacks, if you don't want 100 calorie packs then bring something with you. Don't do what one low life did, nobody wants to share a plane with a burger and fries.

However, the reservations somehow were changed to the day after. The two flights were identical in price, time, and airport. At first we attempted to change the flight. Ignoring the $90 fee, they wanted to charge an extra $270 per flight, though the flights are the same price, currently and when we booked them. Their website states we will ""honor the lower fare"". This is a lie. We then tried to fly stand by but they would not allow this either. The flight was not full either and it is highly unlikely to fill many seats the day of the flight.

It was once a pleasure to fly with them now like most other airlines it had gone back to becoming a terrible experience. Although my bag fit in the designated carry on box they specified, they refused to let me carry it on and forced me to pay for a checked bag. This after my flight being canceled the previous day and forcing to rearrange my schedule.

Jetblue Airways,1,Carmen Iamandii,9th September 2015,"We bought 2 Jetblue tickets from Seattle to New York. We did the online check-in 23h before the departure and our assigned places in the aircraft were 22E for my husband and 24B for me (BOTH in the middle). Even though we bought the tickets together and we were assigned 2 rows apart, we thought we could handle this situation at the airport, as we did before with other airlines. We arrived at the airport and went to the check-in counter to speak with someone. The lady there told us that there is nothing to do if we don't upgrade our seats for an 80$ fee as it looks like we bought the last two tickets and these were the last two places. When we arrived to the gate the gentleman there said ""please come here if you don't have a seat assigned on your ticket in order to give you one"". And that was the moment I realized we were fooled by this company. We went there and asked, how can we have bought the last 2 tickets in this aircraft and have the last two spots in the middle if there are people with no seat assigned? And he just told me “I said you can upgrade for 80$, if you don’t just have a nice trip, bye”. They were rude and impolite, they didn’t solve our problem and it was clear that they have a software that automatically assigns you and your partner far apart just to upgrade and pay more money. None of us was assigned at the window or the aisle because it’s harder to switch places in the aircraft with someone if you are assigned in the middle (if one of us would have had aisle or window seat would have been much easier). Overall, we were very disappointed and angry because they don’t have the desire to help you.

Jetblue Airways,1,Tara Manning,8th September 2015,"After asking the customer service agent at the gate why we were delayed, he responded rudely and treated me as I was stupid for not hearing a pilot announcement. I was sitting by the gate the whole time and didn't hear an announcement. From there I went to customer service to see what the deal was, as well as let them know that the man at the gate was not friendly at all. The service agent was friendly and gave dinner vouchers for the inconvenience. I was thankful. When I boarded - after the flight was delayed twice - there wasn't room on the plane for my computer bag. The flight attendant told me I would have to check it. After I suggested that we see if people can put a small bag under the seat in front of them, he responded saying that my bag would be checked, in a rude fashion. He said he didn't have to deal with me and called security. Not only is that not called for as I was no threat to anyone, but embarrassing. The security guard came down and even told the flight attendant that everything seemed fine. The flight attendant got the pilot and told him he didn't want me on the plane. I am currently sleeping at the airport and can't get home until tomorrow now. I am upset and embarrassed and the show the flight attendant put on. I was frustrated about the delay and bag situation, but certainly was not any kind of threat. The security guard have me a cot to sleep on. He was very nice. As I am writing, I am sleepless in NYC feeling violated and disappointed in the way humans treat other humans.

Jetblue Airways,4,Russell Gibson,3rd September 2015,"So everything was fine for our 11:00pm Jetblue Airways departure to Fort Lauderdale. The inbound plane arrived a little late and we saw the ground crew (who was also the ticket counter crew) scurrying around. At 11:00 p.m. one of the staff announced something (in Spanish) and you could hear some people groan. Fortunately there was a bi-lingual person near us who said, ""They just cancelled the flight."" With that Jetblue announced the flight was cancelled (at 11:30 pm) and all passengers on our flight were to proceed to Gate XYZ, so we did. Once there the non-English speaking staff asked for our passports and wisked them away. An hour later they were returned to us (haphazardly) and we were told to stand in line for buses (no explanation given) but found out we were to be taken to Baggage Claim to get our luggage. We did and got our bags. Then we lined up again (not knowing what for) to get on buses to take us to a hotel. It was now 2:00 am so we complied. We got to the hotel and waited in line again to get a room. We were told we would be taken to the airport at 1:30 to board our flight. After an awesome breakfast (not kidding) we were told we would be taken to the airport at 8:30. Then we got an email saying we were booked on the 11:00 pm flight. But leaving at 8:30 wouldn't be enough time. We called our travel agent, who advised us to just go to the airport and demand to leave. We did and Jetblue got us out. Came to find out the flight we were supposed to be on didn't leave until 6:30 the following morning! Jetblue gave us credits, etc but if they are going to introduce new destination they have to staff the counters with competent staff who can communicate effectively with the passengers.

I usually fly first class US Airways around 7.30pm, but because this is a direct flight and gets me home much earlier, I've been attempting to use it. Key word: attempting. I've had three weddings to attend in Pittsburgh the past two weekends, one now and two in the previous weeks, for the third week in a row, my flight is delayed. Not due to weather, not due to mechanics, ""just because"" the woman at the counter said. It's not delayed just by a little bit, we're talking hours. When I schedule a specific time to fly, I expect to fly on time and if something comes up where the flight won't be on time, I expect to be informed and to be given alternative options. Not once have I received an email, a phone call, a text or even an apology. Unfortunately, for the third week in a row, JetBlue has failed to value my business and my time. I will get the ""lovely"" privilege of spending just a little over 24 hours in my home state, miss my business meeting that was scheduled for tonight.

We opted for the ""Even More Space"" seats which offer 4-5 extra inches of legroom in rows 1-5 and 10-11. We also got priority boarding which is always nice. JetBlue's entertainment helped make the 6 1/2 hour flight seem like 1 hour. Their map is always helpful too. Due to the limited amount of flights JetBlue operates out of San Francisco, they only have 2 gates and they are both in the international terminal, so we had to walk pretty far to get to baggage claim.

Disclaimer however, we were traveling with firearms but even still, it took an absurd amount of time. We waited in line for about 30 minutes wondering what was taking so long but as soon as we got to the counter we figured out why, all the agents were in training with the supervisor skipping from one to the other. We had to first check our firearms and it was clear that the attendent didn't know the slightest about the procedure as he asked the manager after every time he clicked the screen. I had been through the process before I had it prepped but I still had to open and close the case multiple times. Then after deciding it was oversize, we were charged 135$ for the one bag just for being oversize and a second bag.

How could there be 0 seats when I don't have one? Next flight planned a couple of weeks in advance. Go online to pick a seat - 0 seats available! I don't get a seat until I get to the airport - last row, middle seat. On the return leg, I go online again and zip. So I call customer service. After 10 minutes on hold, I explain and am told that it's because I got on the site late. Well, it's not a problem, you'll get a seat. Sure I will, last row, middle, perhaps?

We asked to have two seats together and were told that this would be resolved once the staff had logged in. 15 minutes later, we were called to the desk and found that we had been assigned to More Legroom at no extra cost. We were delighted with this and the seats were very comfortable. We also loved the DirectTv and Sirius Radio live streaming to the aircraft, a unique touch. The unlimited soft drinks and snacks were appreciated. The flight staff were attentive and approachable. The captain coming out to make the pre-flight briefing personally was a great touch.

Also, they acted like they were doing a huge favor by saying our delayed flight was paid by them. We didn't get a refund so we just paid for a later flight. This infuriated me and I tried to explain that it wasn't free for us, and the woman from Jetblue kept saying it was paid by them. So I asked if I could get a refund for the original flight and they said no. I was so mad but couldn't cancel because of the fees for hotel, car, food, and other reservations weren't refundable. It was just an overall horrible experience and ended up in two of us in tears.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Long Beach to Seattle,July 2015,1,1,,,1,1,no
Jetblue Airways,1,Jon Anthony,2nd July 2015,"Comically mismanaged operation. Problems began when the departure gate was mobbed- seems an earlier flight had 'technical problems', so it departed an hour late at my original gate. We were then redirected to an alternate gate, and waited. And waited. And waited. They now had us waiting on the plane with 'technical problems' and they basically had the other flight go out with our intended jet, and we were stuck. It took text message from my daughter thousands of miles away to inform me the flight was finally cancelled. Not one word from JetBlue staff at the boarding gate. Finally, 2 hours after scheduled departure, they announced baggage was at the carousel, and ""being monitored by JetBlue associates"" I went down to claim my bag - no JetBlue staff in sight. I quickly went to ticketing, got an apology and refund from the embarrassed support staff, and proceeded to Southwest, where I ended up having to pay +$500 more for their next direct flight with a confirmed seat. I understand this is a mechanical industry and there will be problems, but it's how an airline manages the problem that is a mark of their business integrity and customer focus. How a major airline doesn't keep a backup vessel on site is mind boggling to me, let alone the abject lack of communication to the paying customer.",Airbus 320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hartford to Tampa,July 2015,1,1,,,1,1,no
Jetblue Airways,1,Amy Blevins,1st July 2015,"It was the first time my children had flown, so I wanted it to be good. From the beginning, JetBlue kept me happy. I had TSA precheck when we arrived, and I didn't ask for it. When we boarded the plane, we boarded first because we had a small child. There was no extra charge for this. Our flight took off 20 min early so we arrived early. During the flight, we were quickly offered snacks and a drink. The attendant came around selling ear buds for $5 to use with the TV at each seat. Having your own TV made the flight enjoyable. At the end of the flight, deplaning was just as pleasant. The price was also better than anyone else, and there were no problems with my luggage. One more thing-my very picky husband who is 6'3"" had plenty of legroom. We did not upgrade to even more space, but he still had plenty of legroom and was very comfortable in a normal seat!",E190,Family Leisure,Economy Class,RDU to FLL,June 2015,5,5,5,5,5,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,3,Rebecca Jones,27th June 2015,"It started out good with complimentary baggage check, drink, and a snack; however on the return flight things quickly changed to bad. Beware of cheap flights - you pay for what you get! Flight delayed an hour, then sat for 2 hours due to mechanical reasons. This company is not considerate of customers or handicap customers and worst they do not partner with domestic airlines - only international airlines therefore if you miss your flight you are out of luck until the next one. The best you are getting is a food voucher.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh-Durham to Las Vegas,June 2015,3,3,3,,2,2,no
Jetblue Airways,5,V Hughes,11th June 2015,"On a flight back to Detroit Metro Airport from Boston Logan, May 28, 2015. First, while we waited to board the flight, the woman at counter announced: ""We are having trouble locating our flight crew, sorry for the delay"" (about 15 min. at this time). Another 10 min. goes by and she announces: ""We know our crew is here somewhere because they flew in, we hope it is just a few more min."" The third time she said ""we have located our crew and it should only be about 10-15 more min. until boarding."" We finally board the plane and we never hear from our captain until ""prepare for landing.""

Jetblue Airways,1,William Waterhouse,29th May 2015,Flight(s) from CHS to DCA and back. Not allowed to select seat assignment when checking in online evening before flights (unless paying for premium seats) poor attitude from airline staff at DCA when I expressed frustration. While speaking with an agent another interrupted the conversation offering his unsolicited opinion. Funny seated dead last group 3 in last available seat. Coincidence? Please note staff at CHS very kind.,,,,,,3,1,,,,3,no
Jetblue Airways,10,Cynthia Beebe,27th April 2015,Flew from SFO-JFK and return flight on JetBlue. Both flights left on time and we arrived at both destinations about 30 minutes early. The crew on the flight was attentive and very friendly. Both on the way to New York and back to SF they asked us about ourselves and our trip. The A321 they fly on trans con flights has a snack bar they open up after they come through with the first round of drinks. It's great being able to get up and get your own snacks without having to call a flight attendant. The entertainment was pretty standard they have live TV and movies you can purchase for $5. The flight crew were also informative. We had a pretty intense bout of turbulence but the captain continued to update passengers the whole time.,,,,,,5,5,4,4,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,6,William Feffer,23rd April 2015,The seat and legroom were excellent. On our flight to Puerto Rico from Chicago we felt the cabin crew were less than exceptional. Drinks came but the snack/food service was much later. They didn't pick up the refuse for a long time. We didn't sense that the crew enjoyed their jobs. The entertainment controls did not function on either of our seats. We were not able to take advantage of the entertainment. On the return leg of our trip the crew was marginally better. We purchased headphones but after about an hour my aisle seat controls stopped working. my wife's center seat controls never worked at all. We were happy with the overall flight otherwise. It was nice to be able to get more than a tiny bag of peanuts.,,,,,,5,3,4,1,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,9,E Simon,28th March 2015,LAX-BOS A320. Boarding zones were a bit strung out although not helped by the people who would show up to the gate as boarding was going on but should have sped it up. On board everything went smoothly. Quick to take-off so was must not have lost our slot. Crew was above par and standard Jetblue entertainment product and snacks. At least one lady in the row in front of me had a TV that did not work so they reset the system. Not a big deal but if you purchased content and already watching that would be a huge pain. Going to miss when they reduce the pitch as the 34' current is great. Arrived slightly early but the crew seemed a bit disinterested to passengers as departing. However minor point. 9/10.,,,,,,5,4,5,5,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,10,V Ortiz,28th March 2015,Flight 906 on 3/17 and 905 on 3/22. I booked a trip to NYC from Chicago and I chose JetBlue based on price and time of flight. Since I'm a student and I was on a budget and I mainly based my decision on price. It was $220 round-trip. I had really low expectations given that this airline is not a big name like others out there but I'm happy to say I had an excellent experience. Both my flights were on time they offered free snacks (no peanuts here legit snacks!) and soda/tea/coffee. The service and the whole experience was great. I would definitely recommend JetBlue.,,,,,,4,5,5,5,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,,A Young,28th March 2015,"My husband and I decided to take a spontaneous trip to San Francisco for my birthday. As we were making travel arrangements to return back to the Miami area JetBlue had the only flight that worked with our time schedule. We were hesitant to book the flight with JetBlue because we did not know much about the company. We decided to give JetBlue a chance and booked flight #578 from SFO to FLL on March 14 2015. It is unfortunate that we did not have a good experience on our first JetBlue flight. The electrical system had issues. The TV on the back of the seats worked at the beginning of the flight but slowly the TVs started going out throughout the cabin (our row did not have a working TV the majority of the 5 hour flight). This made me question what other electrical issues this plane might have. Not only did we have electrical issues but we did not have running water on the flight. My husband and I are both in the medical field and we feel this is not only inconvenient but unsanitary. The ""solution"" was to place multiple bottles of water in the restroom for customers to wash their hands. Partially used and soiled water bottles to wash our hands is not exactly our idea of sanitary. Since the plane did not have running water my husband and I decided to avoid using the restroom for over a 5 hour flight. It also made us question the cleanliness of the flight attendants' hands provided the lack of water on the plane. This is a huge unsanitary issue that should never occur on a plane.",,,,,,3,1,1,1,,1,no
Jetblue Airways,6,Darlagiannis Anna,9th March 2015,I chose JetBlue because I heard great things. I think I had an unlucky streak in which both of my flights were delayed. One being a leaky valve and the second due to weather (out-of-JetBlues control). JetBlue worked really hard to keep me happy and remain their customer. They provided me a credit no questions asked since the delays affected my transportation routes. For them to do that shows that this type of thing does not happen very often. I will also say that the unlimited snacks beverages not to mention all the leg room was a plus. Although I did not have a perfect experience I would definitely recommend JetBlue. Things happen but JetBlue owns up to it and works hard to keep you a satisfied customer. I respect that and their business model of good customer service. I bet if I didn't have the delays the experience would have been perfect.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,5,,4,yes
Jetblue Airways,10,R Sindler,24th February 2015,We just did the Jetblue Mint experience LAX to JFK. We are a couple of airline geeks who took this flight as a Valentines Day gift to each other. Our dedicated Mint flight crew greeted us warmly during boarding including a welcome card with their names. Also waiting at our seats were eye masks and bottled water. Before takeoff we each enjoyed a couple of their delicious signature drinks (they're small). After takeoff we were offered more drinks a Birchbox full of gender specific spa products and dinner. Out of 5 or 6 items we were permitted to choose 3 small plates an appetizer and dessert. Honestly I found some of the food excellent and some not quite as good. They were more than happy to replace one of my choices that I wasn't too happy with. The entertainment was great live TV and free wifi. The movies are not on-demand which made it so that I wasn't able to watch one because I was too distracted with the rest of the Mint experience to pay attention to the start times. In case dinner doesn't fill you the A321 has a self-serve snack bar behind the Mint cabin for anytime bagged snacks and drinks. The seats themselves were comfortable for a 5 hour domestic flight. I liked the firmness controls and massage feature. We sat in a 2 seat bank so we could sit together but the single suites looked very nice for people traveling alone. The single seats have more personal space and a privacy door too. Jetblue really thought our the Mint product well. If you book enough in advance the introductory price is a terrific value. Even last minute bookings still price Mint competitively with UA DL and AA on this route.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,4,4,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,,J Love,24th February 2015,I was scheduled to leave at 8.35 am. There was an issue with the plane and the flight was delayed until 10.00am. We were finally on the plane when the flight was cancelled due to weather. The flight would have made it if we had left on time (the DC airport closed at 1.00 pm). I was rebooked for a new flight the following day. The flight left at 1.00 pm took me to Boston then arrived in DC at 10.00pm. (My original flight was direct.) I was told the airline would not provide accommodations for the night because it was a weather and not a technical difficulty that cancelled the flight of course the weather only became an issue because of the technical difficulty. I went back to the airport early the following morning and was able to book a direct flight to DC that departed at 6.55. I tried to fly standby on the two earlier flight without success. Although this is terrible the worst part was the gate agents. They didn't have the decency to tell me that the flight was full and just walked away from the desk after boarding the flight. Then when I checked in for my 6.55 flight (I hadn't been assigned a seat that morning) they were rude again. I will not fly JetBlue again.,,,,,,4,1,3,3,,3,no
Jetblue Airways,10,C Walsh,19th January 2015,Flew jetBlue Mint class New York to LA and return. Overall a great experience. Was seated in 2A one of four 'single suites.' Very comfortable and private especially when reclined with the suite door closed. The only picky comment is there tends to be some wasted space owing to the single seat configuration and the design could have accommodated a greater seat width. You're also removed from the window so mindless gazing is not really an option unless you unbuckle and lean. The perks in Mint are outstanding not just the lie-flat seat with massage feature but the food and beverage selection amenity kit service from the flight staff and the large video screen. As mentioned in previous reviews not touch screen but that didn't really detract from the experience - you couldn't even reach the screen necessarily when fully reclined. Okay selection of feature films but not VOD. The DirecTV feed is great however and really gives no reason to claim you're bored. The wi-fi complimentary at the moment was hit and miss; fairly good responsiveness when working but did suffer from numerous interruptions. Personalized and attentive service was prominent on both legs and flight time seemingly flew (no pun intended) by. At the current introductory price point Mint is outstanding value. Inevitably jetBlue will adjust their fare pricing to reflect the reality of what is offered however even at a higher cost Mint class should be seriously considered before looking at intercontinental business class on other airlines. jetBlue and its staff should be proud of the Mint product and I will look for any excuse to fly Mint class again.,,,,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,10,C Walsh,19th January 2015,Buffalo to New York - JFK with a connection to Los Angeles (read the latter segment under a separate review). The flight from Buffalo left and arrived on time. The Even More Space seats are very good with plenty of leg room while also providing the benefit of early boarding. Flight crew was personable and attentive. As a first timer with JetBlue I was impressed. Will definitely fly with them again. Great alternative to a Canadian airline out of Toronto for me.,,,,,,4,5,3,4,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,10,S Adlam,14th January 2015,JFK-LAX. Mint Service. Like other reviews of this new First Class Jet blue service it is excellent. Overall it ranked higher than most excellent business class carriers and felt more like BA First which I had just flew in on. The level of the service is high as well as the experience. Meals are better than most carriers and was completely impressed. What I liked the most was the Suite which was private and comfortable with plenty of room for a bed with great bedding. Was completely surprised by this level of service in US. The only downside was the movies were not running but there was plenty of other options. The amenities kit and head set are all top notch. They give American and Virgin a run for the money and considering this service is so well priced I will be flying again!,,,,,,5,5,5,4,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,6,H Christmas,5th January 2015,In December 2014 I took two separate jetBlue flights one from SFO to JFK and then another from JFK to LAX. These flights were fairly long (5 hours) and I found the service to be quite sterile and mediocre. While it was nice that snacks and drinks were made available throughout the flight there were no healthy options aside from water and if you were not prepared to purchase a meal on board chips and cookies were basically your only options for the flight. I feel that this is standard for a flight that may be 1 or 2 hours long but for a longer 5 hour trip I expect there to be meal service included in the price of the fare. I also suffered from severe pain in my right ear during and after landing on both these flights which I had not experienced on another domestic US flight with a different airline that I had taken around the same time nor on any other flight I have had prior or after these two jetBlue ones.,,,,,,5,4,3,4,,3,no
Jetblue Airways,10,Anne-Marie Uebbing,5th January 2015,Just arrived in NYC (LGA) from Fort Myers with my 3 kids and husband. We were really impressed by our experiences on outgoing and returning flights. Great satisfaction with all aspects of travel - boarding inflight service (healthy food and beverage choices entertainment communication service spacious seats and storage).,,,,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,9,Michael Mo,18th December 2014,JFK-IAD ERJ-195 The seat is nice and provides enough legroom. It was a short flight of about 50 minutes. There were personal TV which is good enough for a short flight. You can switch channels to news such as CNN. The flight has snacks and cola for complimentary. It is the best experience I have had on short flight.,,,,,,4,3,4,5,,4,yes
Jetblue Airways,10,R Gibson,10th December 2014,"R/T JFK to LIR (Liberia Costa Rica) in Even More Space seats. The EMS seats entitle you to shorter waiting time at the TSA checkpoint which we needed since we were a little late arriving to JFK. We purchased food to bring on board but ""boxes"" are availlable. No Eat Up Cafe (fresh food) is sold on this flight. The EMS seats have lots of leg room which is great. Our flight attendants both ways were friendly and efficient and complimentary snacks and beverages available at all times. Since we were on an international flight the movies were free but they charge $3 for headphones (which I feel JB should comp for the EMS rows). Overall a great experience. We use this service twice annually to visit our home in CR.",,,,,,4,5,,4,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,10,S Johnson,20th November 2014,Flew between New York JFK and Fort Myers. Checked in online and bag drop at JFK was quick and easy. Flight left on time was 45 mins quicker than originally advised. Leg room was excellent much better than most international airlines complimentary in flight soft drinks and snacks all in all a very good experience and we will use Jetblue again.,,,,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,8,L Barron,12th November 2014,I flew from Boston to Philadelphia with Jetblue on Monday August 25th. The Airline was punctual and the seats were decent. Great airline to use domestically.,,,,,,4,4,,,,4,yes
Jetblue Airways,10,C Samuel,3rd November 2014,Flew Mint Class from LAX to JFK and were impressed with the overall experience. We live in Asia and fly Business or First Class on some fantastic full service Asian based airlines but this Jetblue Mint experience can easily beat most of them. We took the 7am flight on a heavy 100 percent full A321 flight. The check in was smooth with a nice welcome from the ground staff. Our luggage were slightly oversize and above the max. 50 pounds allowance per piece but they were flexible on it hence we didn't need to pay the additional fees. We arrived around 5.30 am hence only a few passengers on the security check and didn't bother to use the express line. The boarding was announced at 6:15 am and the Mint passengers got to board first. We were seated in 3A and 3C which is perfect for couple even though the single suite with sliding door in front and the back of our seats row 2 and 4 were more private. The cabin crew were very helpful in explaining the Mint service seat functions and presented us with menu card. The welcome drink with or without vodka were a delight. It took us a while to learn the full features of the seat as they are so unique and not the usual features you find in other carriers. The thick blanket noise canceling headphones power point container for your phones and sunglasses are very thoughtful. The boarding was completed before 7am and the departure was on time. We got to choose 3 out of five meals prepared by Saxon+Parole which were delicious and nicely presented. The Icecream by blue marble and Mah Ze Dahr cookies in a box were of good quality. One feature we love the most is free and fast wifi as soon as we took off. The non stop TV entertainment although not AVOD was cool and we could watch it as soon as we sat down. The in-massage seat function helped us to relax and dozing off for most 5 hours and 30 minutes flight. I am 6 feet tall and I found the seat is comfortable and I was able to stretch flat out. We arrived at JFK 10 minutes earlier than scheduled and were very happy with our experience. Book early for extreme good value and highly recommend the Mint class to anyone looking for a fantastic First class experience at an affordable price.,,,,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,10,M Lydecker,22nd October 2014,Took flight 1834 from Port-au-Prince to JFK on 10/17/14. What a great experience - almost. The personnel were exceptional. They did everything right. My seat was 1D since no one was in the exit row seats they let me move back and allowed my friend in coach to move next to me he is 6 ft 3 so that was great for him. The attendants were on their game the whole trip and got me coffee after their normal serving time without a hitch. Only problem was my seat sound connection crackled so I used the seat connection next to me. No problem as long as no one is directly next to you.,,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,9,B Martin,22nd October 2014,HPN-MCO. No complaints seats were roomy. Check in was easy both ways. Great entertainment as you could actually watch live TV. No meals offered (short flight). Basic refreshments. Good value!,,,,,,5,5,,5,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,4,R Mackinnon,20th October 2014,I travel a fair amount (7-10 trips a year for biz and pleasure). I am fine with zero amenties for short hauls but I am sorry Boston - San Diego is a long flight. I paid $90 extra for leg room and was still jammed in like a sardine. There was nothing to eat except junk food (salt or sugar) or a cardboard sandwich for purchase. No free wine or beer. If I wanted a cheap blanket and pillow for the red-eye home I had to BUY it (and then had to own it) - I traveled to this business meeting with one carry on - what am I supposed to do with my new jetblue bedding? Talk about a throwaway anti-environmental business model. I had to pay for TV if I wanted it - only good thing is free wifi. I paid over $900 for the ticket. Jet Blue should not treat their transcontinental flyers like this. I would not recommend JB to anyone taking a trip longer than 90 minutes and I would only use them again if I could find no other carrier going to the destination.,,,,,,2,4,1,1,,3,no
Jetblue Airways,10,Peter Pomeranze,8th October 2014,On board Mint class from LAX to JFK. Impressive in all aspects. Seat entertainment food and service. The other carriers better watch out. Provided the pricing remains competitive I'm a convert.,,,,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,4,Brian Lally,28th September 2014,I recently traveled round trip from Boston to Orlando. I traveled out of Boston on September 14 2014 and we were about 20 minutes delayed leaving Boston due to the late arrival of the inbound flight. I have to say it was a great flight and the pilot made up time arriving in Orlando for an on-time arrival the crew were great plenty of legroom plenty of drinks and snacks. The overall flight to Orlando was excellent. Coming home to Boston yesterday was a different story the male flight attendant on the Orlando-Boston route was extremely rude. No smile as we boarded the aircraft no hello to the passengers just miserable. I traveled with 2 friends on board the flight and the tray table was defective and the soda went all over my friends pants. I went to ask this flight attendant for some paper towels and he rudely said get back to your seat because there was turbulence. I understand the safety protocols when it comes to turbulence but at least take initiative to the passengers requests. There was no apology from him for this defective tray table. A female flight attendant who was so nice came to our aid.,,,,,,5,2,3,4,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,3,D Cohen,17th September 2014,We arrived at the airport before 2pm - our flight was at 9.45 pm. Usually when you arrive so far in advance JetBlue try to accommodate you on an earlier flight with no charge. We had the chance to take the flight at 2.40pm JetBlue had space on that flight but they wanted to charge $50 per person (group of 4) instead they put us on stand by for 7 hours. I travel a lot because of my business and I have never had this issue with other airlines.,,,,,,4,4,4,4,,3,no
Jetblue Airways,10,J Harris,9th September 2014,Flew LAX-JFK return in Mint in Aug/Sep 2014. Check in was fast and efficient although slightly hard to find the Mint line at JFK. The food is some of the best I've had inflight and beats any of the other American airlines I've flown hands down. The seat was slightly narrow but the adjustable firmness and subtle massage made up for it. Warm and efficient friendly cabin crew were very helpful but unobtrusive. Flight to JFK departed 50 minutes late but landed on time. Entertainment system is not on demand and the DirecTV has so many advertisements it is infuriating. The feature movies were ad free though. Overall a very good airline who I would definitely fly with again.,,,,,,5,5,5,3,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,9,Milo Diesel,6th September 2014,Flew on Jet Blue 1732 from Bermuda to JFK on Sunday 31/8/2014. Boarding was speedy well organised and efficient with everyone boarded and the plane doors closed 20 minutes ahead of schedule. The flight left Bermuda 15 minutes early and arrived into JFK 25 minutes early which impressed me a lot. Service provided by three polite smiling and delightful crew with drinks and snack run done fairly effortlessly and refills available and delivered with extra ice and a smile. An impressive service that I really rated.,,,,,,4,5,4,5,,4,yes
Jetblue Airways,4,Clear Brian,28th August 2014,"I'm writing about JetBlue's check-in operations at Fort Lauderdale airport. Apparently they have grown their operations there with insufficient and / or unmotivated staff. Trying to check in a bag for a recent flight to JFK took 45 minutes finally being called out of the line and being told ""you are too late"". All this while the lines got longer and their staff stood around chatting. Out of 13 desks 6 were open while I counted at least 9 JetBlue staff hanging around doing nothing except chat. Finally got to the gate only for their personnel there not having a clue about getting passengers onboard in a logical order. They need to up their game at FLL or this passenger will be using another carrier next time. On board service was good friendly and helpful which did mitigate some of the bad feeling about the FLL ground experience.",,,,,,4,2,4,4,,4,no
Jetblue Airways,9,Milo Diesel,28th August 2014,I flew on flight 1731 from JFK to Bermuda. The flight was delayed so boarding started around 30 minutes late. Boarding was pretty chaotic as the PA system was not working properly. Onboard we were greeted by a friendly cabin supervisor who smiled and asked us how we were. Once seated the flight was airborne within 20 minutes an hour later than scheduled. Inflight service was efficient and friendly with drinks served individually from a tray rather than a trolley which was a nice touch with a free snack served from a basket. Landing cards were handed out - it would be great if they had a supply of pens. The flight then arrived around 30 minutes late into Bermuda disembarkment was quick - and I have to say I really enjoyed the flight.,,,,,,4,5,4,4,,4,yes
Jetblue Airways,10,F Boulos,28th August 2014,August 20 2014 flight 124. We flew from LAX to JFK on Mint. I can honestly say that I was very impressed! I have flown business class on many international airlines and the on-board service was comparable in every way. The food was excellent - best I have had on any airline. Flight attendants were friendly courteous and very attentive and our bags were the first to arrive at the carousel as promised. Furthermore the seats reclined to a flat position. All in all a great trip. The one suggestion for JetBlue is to have a small lounge area to accommodate Mint customers at larger airports such as LAX.,,,,,,4,5,5,,,5,yes
Jetblue Airways,1,G Bradley,26th August 2014,Aug 17 New York (JFK) to Orlando Intl (MCO) Flight 883. First time I've flown with JetBlue and it was not a pleasant experience. Told the flight delayed 15 minutes then another 15 minutes and so on. The plane was at the wrong terminal and took them over an hour to get it to the right gate! Boarding process was a farce very slow. 'Snack' was a packet of Doritos served by miserable cabin crew. De-boarding also very slow and then waited ages for our luggage. Only good points were that we got there in one piece and they have good leg room.,,,,,,4,2,2,2,,3,no
Jetblue Airways,1,G Bradley,26th August 2014,First time I've flown with JetBlue and very unimpressed. Plane over one hour late slow boarding slow off- boarding poor service waited ages for luggage. Only good point is the legroom in coach class.,,,,,,4,1,1,2,,3,no
Jetblue Airways,,Marlena Middleton,14th August 2014,Flew from St. Maarten to JFK New York. An announcement came over the loud speaker asking if anyone wanted an upgrade. I mistakenly thought that meant an upgrade to first class. So I paid an extra $150 for my children and I to upgrade only to find out that I paid $150 for approximately a foot and a half extra leg room. I would have never spent my hard earned money on that and I believe that should've been explained to me. I will never fly jetBlue again.,,,,,,3,4,3,3,,1,no
Jetblue Airways,1,G Lettelleir,3rd August 2014,Terrible airline! I fly often with other airlines usually Southwest. I've never waited so long to get my luggage 45 minutes one way and 50 on way home! That's after my flight was delayed by almost an hour waiting on a flight crew! Fly someone else if at all possible!,,,,,,4,3,2,3,,2,no
Jetblue Airways,9,E Irgens,29th July 2014,Flew Mint class from LAX to JFK in July. Check in and boarding smooth and on time. Fantastic crew helpful and kind yet unobtrusive. Meal some of the best I've had inflight much better than BA and QR business long haul. Entertainment system not AVOD so whenever announcements were made I'd miss parts of the film I was watching. Good selection of entertainment though wifi never worked. Seat was the suite-style and very comfortable in all positions but surprisingly narrow in lie-flat. When trying to sleep I had to keep my arms over my chest like a mummy. Still managed to doze off a few hours.,,,,,,4,5,5,4,,4,yes
