Alaska Airlines,1,Clive Thomas,29th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Truly dismal and unprofessional event. At gate 5.30am for advertised 5.55am boarding and 6.35am departure. Delayed, first by 15 minutes, then a further 15 minutes. Helpful gate agent took time to explain a/c had suffered bird strike on last leg of previous evening, but crew hadn't reported it. Morning crew had observed bird debris on walkaround, and needed a licenced engineer to inspect and sign off as airworthy. He was due before 7. He didn't show. Boarding changed to 7.30am. That came and went. No there was no Alaska engineer available so a 3rd party was coming. He arrived but wasn't licensed for the E175! Promises of 8am departure came and went. Several discussions were had with gate staff who promised the flight wouldn't be cancelled. At 8.20, after all my alternatives had departed, the flight was cancelled. Yes, the refund was set up instantly, but my careful prepared business meeting got burned, all down to a total lack of responsibility and process by the previous evening's crew. Anyone except Alaska next time, which is a shame. In all my years of travel, this is my first 1 rating, and that's for processing the refund.",Embraer 175,Business,Economy Class,San Jose to Burbank,Sep-18,3,3,,,1,1,no
Alaska Airlines,10,Bill Baker,19th September 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Los Angeles. Excellent first class seats on this A320. Only two rows of first class but the seats are wonderful for U.S. domestic First. The Alaska Airlines staff were wonderful and the overall experience could not have been topped. All of the seat functions worked and the plane is very comfortable.,A320,Solo Leisure,First Class,Las Vegas to Los Angeles,Sep-18,5,5,5,4,5,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,7,R Jones,17th September 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Overall a pretty good experience. I was able to change seating with a simple phone call just after booking. The plane left on time. The flight crew seemed well trained. It seems to be a discount airline and they charge for check in bags and any food. But the price was good and I was not expecting a lot.,Boeing 737,Business,Economy Class,San Diego to Kahului,Sep-18,3,4,,,4,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,2,T Buhl,11th September 2018,"Not Verified | Seattle to Reno. The flight itself was smooth. The steward was very rude. They wouldn't serve soda, even though the cart was full. They said the flight was too short to serve drinks, but served water, juice and you could buy alcohol. That makes zero sense that the flight was too short to serve drinks, (soda only), but they served drinks. That being said, my flight home, which was the same distance, served drinks including soda. Still scratching my head on that one. Anyhow, we were shortly going to start the descend into Seattle so I started to get up to use the bathroom and the FA very rudely told me to sit back down, I could not use the bathroom. It was another 10 minutes from the time he told me I couldn't use the bathroom until the fasten seat belt sign came on. Then he came by and got in my face and again, rudely told me to put my seat back up. I didn't even realize my seat was back because the person behind me kept pulling my seat and apparently it reclined it and I didn't notice it. He could have politely asked me. I was never rude to him although maybe I should have been. Even the people around me kept saying ""what is this guys problem"". I have never been on a flight with such horrible behavior from a steward. My flight home was great until I retrieved my luggage. My zippers were ripped off my bag and someone had gone through my bag. I thought if TSA searches your bag, they have to put a note in your bag that they have done so. I have had this happen before; there was no note that TSA searched my bag so if this is protocol, then Alaska should be keeping an eye on their employees. I feel very violated. It's probably a good thing I didn't have anything worth stealing in there.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Reno,Aug-18,2,1,1,,2,2,no
Alaska Airlines,9,C Guerrero,8th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I had such a great experience with Alaska Airlines. We missed our flight by only 5 minutes and they were super accommodating and understanding and were able to get me on the next flight out to Seattle, WA from San Diego within the next two hours. They were very friendly and welcoming. Will definitely be booking with them again.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Seattle,May-18,4,4,4,4,5,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,6,Tony Hall,7th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Vancouver to Fairbanks via Seattle. First Class. Alaskan First is better than otherâ€™s premium economy and European domestic business, very similar to Qantas domestic business. FAs available, friendly and attentive at all times. Contrary to impression given by their website and check-in staff, I was denied lounge access at YVR. Although the flight to Seattle is timetabled for an hour, because, so we were told, we were in the air for only half an hour there was no in-flight catering at all. Why should that mean no welcome drink? Ground congestion at YVR delayed us and we only just made the connection at Seattle. Ground congestion there was extreme, nearly an hour from push back to take-off. This meant that we did not get lunch until nearly 4 pm. Catering when it finally arrived was good, though. My bag did not make the connection and was eventually delivered to me at 11.30 pm at my Fairbanks hotel. As a result, I received an e-mail apology and offer of a discount on a future flight, more than you get from some carriers.",Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,First Class,Vancouver to Fairbanks via Seattle,Aug-18,4,5,3,3,4,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,L Stean,2nd September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Newark. This airline moved me to a way later flight for my connecting flight to Newark without my knowledge and despite my on time arrival to the gate. Now, I am 5 hours delayed. The transfer from LA terminals was not easy as well. Unacceptable decisions by the ticketing office. Unbelievable.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Newark,Sep-18,,,,,1,1,no
Alaska Airlines,1,W Davidson,30th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | After vacationing in Alaska we used Alaska Airlines - needless to say we won't make that mistake again. We landed in Seattle and had about a 2 hour layover. We grabbed a bite to eat and headed for our gate only to find no one there. We asked if there had been a gate change and found out that yes it was changed. The agent was about as personable as a badger. We had to jump on the train and get to another concourse and fortunately made it there in time. The ticket agent at this gate, who had her hair piled on her head that looked like a birds nest was about as pleasant as the previous agent. We finally got onboard and sat there for the next two hours. The plane had sustained a bird strike which required a one hour maintenance review. The next hour was spent waiting for them to fuel the plane which was not taking fuel. After a two hour delay we finally took off. Upon our arrival in Dallas we went to collect our luggage. It used to be brown, clean and very nice. That is no longer the case. Least I mention that I am also missing a shoe which leads me to believe that baggage handlers went thru my luggage. Needless to say I was furious and was told that no one was available to take our claim at that hour of night. We incurred further expenses because we had to book a hotel as we had been up since 2 am, it was then 9 pm and we still had to make a 3 hour drive to get home. I also had to pay my dog sitter an additional day. I have filed a complaint within Alaska Airlines policy of making said complaint within a 24 hour window. Thus far all I have gotten back from them is an email acknowledging the complaint and that it will take them approximately 30 days to respond. Their customer service is non-existent! They don't care about their passengers or their belongings - they care about how many nickels and dimes they can squeeze out of you. They ruined our vacation!",Boeing 737,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Anchorage to Dallas,Aug-18,2,2,1,,1,1,no
Alaska Airlines,5,Cherish Gaye,24th August 2018,"Not Verified | Honolulu to San Diego August 23, 2018 I was flying out with my 7 month old and a 5 yr old daughters. I was hoping the flight attendants would be a more compassionate because at the airport the staff was able to give us comfortable seat. One flight attendant was rude unlike the older ones who were nice, it was understandable that they have policy but she could have tell it nicely like changing diapers like she could have said in a nicer tone that itâ€™s only allowed In lavatory we understand that. Then my 5yrs old vomited and by that we were cleaning up the plastic bag they were collecting trash so we said we have a vomit but in a bag and she rudely said it should be thrown in the lavatory, the older attendant was very nice accommodating our needs, she nicely said they couldnâ€™t hold it but I can put it in the trash bag myself.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to San Diego,Aug-18,4,1,2,3,5,3,no
Alaska Airlines,10,Yonatan Kahn,24th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Santa Rosa. I flew solo to go and visit family in Northern California. It was my first time flying Alaska Airlines since I had flown Virgin America Before then as my main airline. The plane had very comfortable seats and had a lot of legroom for the size of the plane. For food, you get the option between a cold drink, tea, or coffee, and a Biscoff Cookie. The flight had a very good view since we were so low in altitude. After flying on this flight I would recommend Alaska Airlines.",Bombardier Q400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Santa Rosa,Aug-18,5,5,5,,5,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,D Neales,23rd August 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to San Francisco. Terrible customer service. Flight was delayed and they assured us we would have plenty of time to make it to our connecting flight. We did not. Only barely just made it running through the airport with my wife and 2 year old son. Plane almost left without us. Oh and we also checked our stroller at the gate and they didn't give it back to us - they want us to pick it up back in San Francisco.,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to San Francisco,Aug-18,3,3,3,,1,1,no
Alaska Airlines,1,Brittany Madden,22nd August 2018,"Not Verified | Dallas to La Guardia. I have been flying with Virgin for a long time and loved every flight with them. Since they have merged with Alaska everything, including most of the flight attendants has gone downhill and fast. Even first class flights with them you have a 50% chance of having a rude flight attendant. I have had delays my last six flights, runs out of food, wont fill up a water bottle for you, changing the support dog policy and not notifying anyone, Customer service line is like speaking to a robot telling you the same sentence over and over again. I will be going out of my way to travel DFW airport so I don't have to deal with the delays and rude people who are think they are better than you. Get it together Alaska, you are officially the worst airline on a consecutive basis i have ever flown.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to La Guardia,Aug-18,1,1,1,1,2,1,no
Alaska Airlines,3,S Charman,22nd August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Seattle to Portland. Terrible experience with our carry-on luggages. My husband and I were required to check our carry-ons because we were informed right before entering the plane, that the plane was too small for luggages. We never received luggage tags and were told to go ahead and board, that we could pick up our bags immediately after the flight. This flight was delayed 45 minutes, we arrived in Portland only about 10 minutes before our connecting flight to Detroit was leaving. When we attempted to pick up our carry-on bags from the people unloading on the tarmac, we were told to head to our connecting flight and that our luggages were also going to Detroit. We asked the gentleman unloading to allow us to take our luggages with us, since they were on the cart in front of us but not tagged, however he refused and told us he would be sending them to Detroit and was bringing them down in 4 minutes. Even though it was clear he had no way of knowing which luggages were ours and needed to go to DTW. At the gate before boarding the plane, we again explained the situation to one of the gentleman in charge of the boarding process and that our luggages had been taken from us, however, we never received any luggage tags. He asked us to describe the bags and assured us we would have them once we landed at DTW. Once we landed at DTW we headed to baggage claims, however, our bags never arrived. We proceeded to the Alaskan bag check-in counter, since the Alaska baggage service office was closed and there was no sign indicating when it would open. There was a gentleman who finally assisted us by having us write down our information. However, he said since we did not have official luggage tags no further inquiry could be made. When we insisted we receive some sort of confirmation or claim report to verify record of this incident he assured us his supervisor would meet us at the baggage claim service center to assist us further. We returned to ground level and waited in front of the door for over 20 minutes before returning upstairs to see if she would still be coming to meet us. We spoke with the same gentleman who helped us earlier he assured us she was on her way. After returning downstairs and waiting for another 15 minutes she came and took an official claim. The entire ordeal lasted for almost 2 hours. Due to the incident our transportation to home was delayed and my husband was unable to make it to work. When I arrived home I spent the majority of my day on hold with Alaska Air. I was on hold for over 2 hours, the operator said I would receive a call back in over 3 hours! When I finally received a call back I was placed on hold again for another 20 minutes, the person I spoke with said our luggages should be leaving Portland only that night and which would arrive at 4 am the next day. When I asked them to confirm they were out luggages, they could not. It was over 24 hours and we did not receive any updates on the status of our lost luggage from DTW service center. Furthermore, I repeatedly tried calling Alaska Air baggage service office with which we made a claim at (DTW) and was unable to speak with a representative, no one picked up. Over 8 calls and 4 emails later, our luggages were returned dirty and scratched the following afternoon, with no communication from Alaska Air luggage service center. This is the worst customer service I have ever received from an airline! We are very disappointed with how the entire situation was handled.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Portland,Aug-18,2,2,2,2,1,1,no

Alaska Airlines,3,Francis Murphy,10th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | The last 2 days have been a nightmare traveling with Alaska Airlines. First, my flight from seattle to Redmond/Bend on 8/7 was delayed 2hrs after the pilot came on the intercom just prior to turning on the runway to let us know that a fuel hatch light came on and forced us back to the terminal and eventually changed planes. Then my flight on 8/8 from Rendmond to Portland was delayed because the crew could not figure out how to distribute the weight on the aircraft. This caused a 30 min delay. Finally, my flight from Portland to Seattle also on 8/8 (writing as I still wait in another delay) has been delayed now 2 going on 3 hours. What happen to Alaska Airlines being #1 in on time performance. This has honestly been a terrible experience. Hope they could get things figured out, as Alaska use to be my top choice to fly.",,Business,Business Class,Portland to Seattle,Aug-18,3,3,2,2,3,2,yes
Alaska Airlines,3,Chris Lowry,4th August 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Phoenix to Spokane. You just lost a frequent flier. As we were boarding several people received text from Alaska stating the flight was delayed 45 minutes due to the Blue Angles flying in Seattle. Instead of stopping the loading process we continued to load for another 30 minutes and then sat on the Tarmac in Phoenix for 65 minutes.

Alaska Airlines,2,Peter Calimlim,2nd August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Seattle to San Diego. Worst flight ever. It was an absolute circus. First, the flight attendants were a half hour late. Then, after about 45 minutes of sitting on the runway, a man in an orange vest came on board holding a small plastic cover. He then asked us to stand up and help him find out where the missing part came from. Totally unprofessional.

While I understand there may be issues with airplanes from time to time, itâ€™s sad to see the poor level of customer service coming from the Alaska attendants at our gates. The flight continues to be delayed with them not giving people an update. If you want to keep everyone happy, you should consider updating as much as possible over the PA. This is also known as communication. People shouldnâ€™t have to tell each other what is happening because the staff refuses to give the update.

Alaska Airlines,1,Chris Royer,10th July 2018,"Not Verified | Los Angeles to Seattle. Our flight was scheduled in the morning. When we got to our gate they informed us the plane had to have maintenance done and that the flight would be delayed for one hour. After an hour, they delayed another hour. This continued for 8 hours in the airport (even getting to an annoying every 10 minutes or so boarding time change). Once we finally got on the flight, our tray tables were broken and the net that was supposed to hold our belongings was torn to shreds so we had to put all of our snacks in the overhead. My chair cushion was also broken so it would continually slide forward and make me incredibly uncomfortable. The plane was only half full because at this time many passengers had gone on other planes. They would not allow me to switch to a seat that was not torn up despite the vast vacancy on the plane.

I called to see about compensation for the fact that we had to pay for our checked bag with Hawaiian and both of us had to call into work. Not to mention the fact that we were stuck at the airport for 3 hours tell we were helped.

Alaska Airlines,1,S Roh,27th June 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | I paid more than $300 for first class ticket from Santa Ana to San Francisco and when I booked for my ticket no one informed me that i have to take shuttle from San Jose airport to go to SCO. I only found it out when I was checking in and they said i should arrive to shuttle at 2.30. Obviously I thought the shuttle bus will be ready when i arrive at the airport but it wasn't. The first two shuttles were taken by those who had connection flight at the SCO so i waited for more than an hour to get on the shuttle. When I called the customer service centre they said there will be no compensation for this flight because it wasn't their fault. More than half on this flight found out about the changes after they got on board. You charged me the full price for first class ticket when you already knew that I will only enjoy it for like 30 min on the plane. All my plans and schedules got delayed and screwed.

Alaska Airlines,1,X Zhang,23rd June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Kahului Maui to San Jose. When we flew to Hawaii, they said we went to the boarding gate too late, so they gave me and my 3 year old 2 separate seat in 2 different rows. I told him this is not acceptable and this is not good service. He replied, â€˜I provided good service by assign you premium seats.â€™ I rolled my eyes and told him that I donâ€™t care about premium seats, but the 3 years old cannot be seated alone. Luckily there are other passengers willing to switch seats with us. Now I am flying back. I try to check in online and select seats. I realized that they already assigned the seats for us. Again, my 3 years old is sitting by herself! You have the kidâ€™s age when we purchase the ticket, you should know automatically they have to be with their parents. The whole Hawaii trip is awesome and I would never use Alaska Airlines again. Such a disappointment that Virgin America is now part of Alaska. They used to have good services.

Alaska Airlines,10,Paul Spencer,19th June 2018,"Not Verified | Seattle to San Diego. Alaska Airlines is the best. I don't think there is another domestic airline that gives first class passengers access to their lounge, downer is there is not a lounge at San Diego but that's not the airline's fault. Service on board is great with decent food and usually great wines. The lounge in Seattle is always very busy but it is always possible to find a seat and get a pre-flight beverage, food however is not that great in the lounge compared with the Amex Centurion lounge but they feed you well on the flight!

Alaska Airlines,9,Lindsay Pulliam,19th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Reno - Anchorage, Fairbanks - Reno. All flights were on time except a one hour delay that we were aware of and kept updated on, so no problem there. The planes made a few scheduled stops in Ketchikan, Sitka, Yakutat and Cordova so got to see a little bit more of Alaska then planned. The ground staff were pleasant and did not give us grief even with one of our bags being 10 lbs. over weight. Thought that was very nice and unexpected. The flight crew were pleasant on all flights with greetings upon boarding and goodbye's upon disembarking. Drinks and snacks provided on most all flights except some of the very short 25 minute flights. Only had to pay for baggage on one flight and all the others were free. On our flight home from Fairbanks there had been a booking error which was the fault of Alaska Airlines which we discovered before our scheduled departure luckily and when calling customer service they were extremely helpful, corrected the error and gave us a free upgrade on the flight. Very nice gesture indeed. It had been many a year since I last flew with Alaska Airlines and can honestly say I was impressed with their service on all levels. Planes were comfortable and clean and the staff seemed to enjoy their jobs. Not grumpy, rude or in any way negative about anything.

Alaska Airlines,1,Eric Atallah,14th June 2018,"Not Verified | Seattle to Las Vegas. I fly Alaska Airlines almost every domestic trip I take, however that has recently changed. I will no longer fly Alaska. On a recent flight, my wife and I were among the last passengers to board, and were forced to check our carry on luggage (1 small suit case), because we were told there was limited overhead space. We begrudgingly accept and board the plane to find about half the overhead space completely empty. I'm not exaggerating here either. There was room for another 30+ luggage bags. I immediately ask the nearest stewardess why we were being asked to check our bags with all the obvious available space, and she responds with: ""We are concerned about overhead space filling up"". I shoot her a confusing look and then look to the ample available overhead space, and she doesn't respond. This definitely sounds like a lame and nit-picky complaint, but we were meeting a friend at our destination who would be waiting on us to share a cab with, and the extra 20 minutes waiting for our checked luggage is a bit ridiculous.

I booked a one way flight from Denver to SFO (FL 1867) scheduled to depart at 516 PM. On arrival to DIA, told new departure time was 6 PM. They had to wait for ""paperwork"". Finally boarded after an hour then sat in plane for over another hour because they said their tug had a dead battery. At this point they had to get another pilot or co-pilot as they had already worked more then permitted hours. Finally we were underway over 2 hours late and we were told gate agents would meet us with information on connecting flights. We landed then had to wait to taxi to a gate and officially arrived 2 hrs and 31 minutes late. There was no gate agent there on arrival and I missed my connecting flight to Palm Springs. I had to look for a departing Alaska flight to find an agent. I had checked online and there was a United flight leaving at 1030 PM that I could have made had there been an agent to meet us. I could have been given a hotel voucher but decided to take a 6 AM flight to LAX so i ended up at airport all night. Then Alaska told me they would Uber me to Palm Springs at their expense as there were no flights to PSP that day. My Uber driver didn't find me so I had to wait in line again for 40 minutes and Alaska did send me to Palm springs by Super Shuttle.

Alaska Airlines,1,S Deane,31st May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to San Francisco. I decided to try them out because I've heard they were good. Never again. Several minutes before the boarding time, there was no plane at the gate. The gate agents were nonchalantly chatting and poking around on their terminals. No announcements or explanations. Passengers wondering aloud what is going on. When the boarding time ""came and went ""with still no plane at the gate, only then did their app update with what I would soon discover was a random new boarding time. After another update, the plane arrived and we all boarded a roasting plane. The captain said there was no APU available at that gate to boost the AC. We were an hour late by now. Nothing was ever mentioned about the lateness so I assume it's normal for them to be late. Then, the plane had a mechanical issue at startup. They apparently have no pull at Denver International, because it took 20 mins for anyone to even arrive at the plane to examine the problem. The prognosis was not good, so they let everyone deplane again. They asked people to ""stay in the area"" although for much of the time there was no Alaska Airlines staff at the gate counter - just a bunch of passengers wondering what was going on. After another 30 mins the flight was canceled. My impression was that this airline, at least in Denver, is amateurish. They offered compensation by a computer-generated ""heartfelt"" email, but it was just a credit toward a future flight. It's like ""sorry about the bad service, here is a coupon for some more bad service."" Alaska Airlines is dead to me.

First and foremost they should have stated that for passenger that siting on row 8 and 9 (behind and front of emergency exit) that their seats canâ€™t recline! Itâ€™s a 5 hours flight. You expect me to sit straight for the whole time? I booked this flight on October of 2017, which is 6 months in advance and they didnâ€™t bother to state the seat wonâ€™t recline? The passenger in front of me recline their seat all the way so it was even more difficult to move or to eat. The meal tray canâ€™t even put all the way down, so I asked the flight attendant to help me ask the passenger in the front to move the seat up a little so I can eat. The flight attendant say she canâ€™t do it because itâ€™s the passenger right to recline all the way or changed seat but all seats are taken - so what about my rights? My rights were taken away from me. Although she later ask the passenger to move a little so I can put the tray down but I already felt disrespected.

Alaska Airlines,2,C Aguilar,23rd May 2018,"âùŒ Not Verified | Having been a dyed in the wool Virgin fan, I was eager to see how Alaska measured up. They didn't. I flew back from Philly on a Sunday evening (7:45 scheduled departure). The flight didn't take off until 10 p.m. I wasn't notified via text until 6:30 that it was delayed (same thing happened on the flight from SFO to Philly). Had I been notified a bit earlier, I could have stayed and had dinner with my son before going to the airport. How is it passengers aren't notified sooner than an hour before the flight that there are system wide delays due to air traffic control issues in Philly that had been an issue for hours on both flights? Worse yet, I flew First Class and was looking forward to seeing how it matched up with Virgin. Sadly, no comparison at least no in this flight. While the flight attendant was good, they seemed totally unprepared for passengers. He had to go to the back to get mixers each time. Dinner was a mess. I got the vegetarian entree I didn't order, followed 25 minutes later by part of my original order which was stone cold.

Alaska Airlines,1,C Marston,23rd May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Fort Lauderdale to San Francisco. I have never flown with Alaska Airlines before. I had heard good things and was looking forward to my direct flight home from a week long vacation. Unfortunately however, I had a terrible experience. Before we took off, the flight was delayed several times. The lack of information from Alaska staff was the worst I have experienced. During the initial two and a half hour delay the only announcement that had been made said ""The flight will be delayed by 80 minutes due to weather, which is good news compared to what I was hearing."" Alaska staff seemed surprised when people came up to the desk with frustration. After boarding three hours late and being requested to buckle seat belts, we were told we'd be off the ground asap, max 30 minutes. The flight took off 80 minutes later with absolutely no further announcement. Once up in the air, my seat did not go back. My screen brightness buttons did not work. My headphone jack did not work. There was no USB charger. And the wifi did not connect for the entire six hour flight. If all this wasn't bad enough, Alaska flight staff then decided to offer double shot free alcohol to a clearly unstable gentleman sitting in the seat closest to the exit row door. This decision put the safety of all passengers on board at risk. After 3-4 large drinks, the gentleman proceeded to shout loudly on at least 10 separate occasions, and continued to act erratically. After another gentleman on the exit row requested to be moved, he was left alone in the exit row to potentially open the emergency door in his inebriated state, or perform action in an emergency situation! My wife was seated directly in front of this now drunk, unstable man and genuinely feared for her safety. Finally the Pilot was summoned to threaten an emergency landing and FBI action. Quite frankly, my wife and I and several other passengers we talked to were just relieved to land safely. Needless to say we will never fly with Alaska again.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to San Francisco,May-18,1,3,3,2,1,2,no

But after boarding the plane a mechanical issue arose, which took another 3.5 hours to resolve and again I missed connecting flight.

Enjoyed the Admirals Club at AUS, which still has a great staff, even though food offering are lagging Delta's or United's Clubs. Quick boarding as this jet only holds about 70 passengers. For a regional jet, seats are plenty wide and comfortable with average at best legroom. Power port at every seat is nice. Pre departure beverage and an on time departure. Right after take off, First class was treated to Virgin America's signature smoothies, which I enjoy and I thought this level of service, along with a printed menu indicated a fine meal was forth coming. I'm a fan and love airline food and never complain, however the meal, if you can call it that was the most appalling breakfast I have ever seen, on a plane or the ground. Half dollar size, dry and cold scrambled eggs and a salmon cake of similar size. Thats it. Beverages served in plastic cups. No mugs for coffee either. Just abysmal. The return flight, easy check-in despite the poor condition old San Diego's terminal 1. No lounges, poor food options, as we thought of eating before getting on the flight, due to the service on the way to San Diego. Fast boarding, no pre departure beverage this time, no problem, once airborne, printed menus again, followed by warm nuts in a ramekin, then a large, nicely presented dinner of chicken with wine sauce. Rice and whole grains were on the side. Bread warm bread with butter and a small dessert of apple crumb cake. Over all very satisfy and tasty.

Far more of my flights with them have left late than have left on time. This is a recurring problem at every airport: O'Hare, Juneau, SeaTac. I have missed connecting flights and ferries due to long delays. My most recent trip to Alaska involved sitting in the plane for 2 hours at the gate in SeaTac because they didn't have a pilot! They boarded us knowing the pilot was probably somewhere over the Dakotas at the time and just left us sitting there. For 2 hours. With no airflow. We were offered about 4 oz of water exactly once in that 2 hours. While Alaska does have great customer service, to me that just doesn't make up for being treated like a farm animal once on the plane. Make sure you've booked a 3+ hour layover or you most likely won't make your connector. And they will lie to you the entire time you're waiting, ""just another 20 minutes and we'll be pushing off!""

The terminal itself is undergoing renovation and had very limited dining and shopping options. The plane was full. Boarding was a bit chaotic largely because of limited space in front of the gate. During the flight, several runs of beverages were made. Varieties of food were on sale. The cheese platter I had was excellent. The cabin was bright and clean and leg space was sufficient. iPads were available to rent to watch a movie. There was ample overhead space to stow your luggage. The lavatories remained reasonably clean on this 6+ hours journey. Flight attendants were extremely friendly and efficient. The inflight experience on the flight from Seattle to Fairbanks was similarly positive though the plane had fewer seats than the one originally scheduled for that flight. Consequently, quite a few passengers had to be rebooked on later flights. The gate agents were extremely courteous yet firm. Luckily, my seat had been preserved on the connecting flight. The flight was on schedule. Alaska airlines provided a refreshingly positive flight experience. It was largely the result of a friendly attitude of the crew.

Alaska Airlines,3,Cassidy Huotari,18th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Seattle to Minneapolis. I have always flown with Delta because their customer service is outstanding andhad great experiences. However, I was unable to book a flight through them so I chose Alaska Airlines being that I had heard good things. I flew with my 7 month old baby and had my car seat and stroller with. I booked her as a lap infant and was told I could check in my car seat and stroller right before getting on the plane. The woman who assisted me, being that it was my first time traveling with a baby, gave me a large plastic bag and zip ties and said whoever was at the plane helping load, would place my car seat and stroller in the bag that way they would be protected and not dirtied or ruined.

Alaska Airlines,1,M Norton,7th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Originally scheduled to fly from Dallas Love Field Airport directly to LaGuardia. There was inclement weather forecasted for NY later that day, so I paid a $25 change fee to fly out on a different flight that departed 2 hours earlier around 10:30 am. However, the storm hit NY earlier and my new flight was delayed over 4 hours and eventually canceled after sitting on the tarmac for an hour. Once we were notified of the cancellation, I called Alaska Airlineâ€™s customer service to rebook my flight. There were no direct flights available and there were no flights available to get me home that day. I was offered two options on different airlines: either fly to Seattle that night and take a red-eye to JFK or fly to Los Angeles and take a red-eye to JFK. Neither option would get me to LaGuardia, which was where my car was parked or get me home in time for an important event I had scheduled for Thursday morning. Because of this, the customer service representative offered me a $75 travel credit, reimbursement for the flight change fee that I paid for my canceled flight, and reimbursement for my travel from JFK to my car at LaGuardia. Once I returned home, I called Alaska Airlineâ€™s customer service to work out the reimbursements; however, I was told the airline does not provide reimbursements for flights canceled due to weather. While I understand that the airline is not responsible for delays due to weather, it is completely unacceptable for the airline to not fulfill what I was originally promised. Especially after sitting in an airport for over 10 hours, making me pay for a change fee for a flight that was canceled, arriving in a different airport, and booking an inconvenient layover on the opposite side of the country.

Now today, on my return flight, my boyfriend and I booked using ""companion fare."" He's been an Alaska cardholder forever, and he purchased his ticket full price while giving me the discounted companion rate. He had a medical emergency that prevented him from getting on the plane, and I was literally told to leave the plane 5 minutes before take-off since my boyfriend was no longer flying with me. We paid for his ticket, never asked for or expected a refund since it was a last minute emergency, and I paid my companion fare price in full. I'm not unreasonable - I understand that the ""rule"" states we must be flying together. But that ""rule"" was never made clear to us in the booking process, and we couldn't have seen this emergency coming. My real issue is with the way I was treated - the flight attendants loudly told me to ""exit the plane immediately,"" forcing me to inconvenience everyone in my row so that I could get my bags down and haul them through the isle once more. I got all the way to the door (walking past 24 rows of people) when they informed me that the boarding door had closed, and they'd ""be forced to allow me to fly - but never again in the future would this be allowed.""

The company was therefore allegedly not responsible for reimbursement of anything. Our flight left at about 1130pm scheduled to arrive at around midnight. Strangely, there were many other planes that landed and yet our was unable. We were then told to just go to customer service where probably 100 passengers lined up to wait while they offered a 9pm flight the following day and no other reimbursement.

Alaska Airlines,1,B Davidson,30th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Flight from Hawaii to Seattle OK, good sevice from crew. Connecting flight from Seattle to Victoria, a short 30 min. flight, total disaster. Flight cancelled due to ""weather"" (so airline assumed no liability and provided no assistance, even for overnight stay in Seattle), when the weather at both the origin airport (SEA) and the destination airport (YYJ) was clear (ceiling at Seattle at least 7,000 feet, visibility at YYJ posted online at that time of day as > 12 miles with one passenger hearing a report from his family at destination that they could see stars in the sky, winds low (< 10mph), no precipitation. Of all of the bogus claims I have ever been subjected to, this one has got to be one of the worst. A Delta flight flew the same route just 20 minutes earlier without delay. The cancellation was announced almost an hour before departure - without even waiting to see whether, in fact, weather remained (or ever was!) an issue. No other cancellations observed on the screens at SEA that night and no other cancellations shown online at YYJ. Apparently, there had been fog at YYJ the two previous nights, so my only guess here is ""pre-emptive cancellation"" (a cancellation because someone thought there *might* be fog again but didn't bother to either check or wait to verify). The next day, there was a wait list for the first flight out. My wife and I had gotten the last 2 tickets on that flight. After Alaska offered $0 for the overnight delay and their phone number for discounted hotel rooms [""at passenger's full expense but we'll at least help you get a discount""] turned out to be worthless (phone number had automated, ""sorry, no rooms available"" message), they NOW offered $400 each for people willing to give up their seats and fly 2-3 hours later. Normally, I'd say ""sure"" if this was a non-work day (I tend to jump at anything above $150/hour) But my wife's wisdom on this question was worth listening too: ""$400 in cash? sure. $400 in airline coupons good on Alaska? Worthless! We are not flying this airline again!"" Alaska had the one and only flight connection that allowed us to get home from Hawaii without enduring an overnight flight.

Alaska Airlines,8,D Z Kong,7th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Vancouver to Seattle. Outbound from YVR to SEA was a good flight, until touchdown at Sea-tac. The flight departed and arrived on time, except it gated late. Reason being was another aircraft was getting deiced at our gate. The flight gated late by about 20 minutes - airport's problem. Otherwise, pretty solid flight; good attitude from cabin crew; cabin lights shut off in the duration of the flight so people could sleep; no food or drinks served due to the shortness of in-air time; clean interior. Inbound from SEA to YVR in the same afternoon was cancelled due to snow. (This is an Alaska flight operated by Horizon Air.) Went to the counter and was told to go to customer service - which had about a 2 hour line. They cancelled a lot of flights. Wanting to come home I booked a one-way with AC. After my return to YVR, I received a text from AS that I got rebooked on an 11pm flight to YVR, which I no longer need. I called Alaska, lined up and got a call back after an hour.

Alaska Airlines,1,TrÃºc Nguyen,24th October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Orange County to San Francisco. My first and last time flying Alaska Airlines. Our flight was supposed to leave at 8:47am, then delayed twice because of San Francisco grounding international flights (yet we were domestic trip, but Alaska Airlines parks in the international terminals at SFO). When delayed for a 3rd time, the attendant at the booth stated the next flight will not leave until 2:50pm. We confirmed with attendant to make sure there will be no chance for an earlier flight and he stated ""No, there will be no earlier flight then 2:50pm and to check on Alaska Airline app or website for updates."" It was 10:45am, so we decided to leave airport to grab lunch and come back for 2:50pm flight (we were not the only passengers that left airport). While at lunch my boyfriend checked website and app (which did not work) on his phone, so I checked my phone and it stated 11:30am flight boarding. We decided to call 800# customer service to get clarification. Customer Service Rep stated they show 11:30am flight, we explained our situation and all they said was ""You should have not left the airport"". I called the airport directly to confirm and make sure Alaska Airlines knew what they were talking about, at this point we have lost all faith on anything Alaska Airlines were telling us. The airport called to the gate for us and confirmed they are boarding and will taking off at 12pm. We called back to Alaska Airlines and explained again our situation to another customer service rep. Alaska Airlines rep scheduled us to be on the next flight to SFO at 4:30pm. We asked if they could do anything for us (move us up 1st class, comp drink tickets, etc). No, as delay was not Alaska Airlines fault it was SFO, yet they did not even listen that it was their attendant who gave us false time. We arrive back at the airport by 3:30pm and plane was delayed 2 more times to 5:50pm because crew was stuck in SFO and flying down. We get into SFO by 8pm (an hour flight that took almost 11 hours of our time)!

I had a 1 hour and 21 minute layover and was supposed depart on Virgin America from LA to Boston. The flight out of Seattle was delayed until 8.45pm. I got out of the plane at 1124pm and missed the 1126 flight to Boston. The crew on the flight said there would be a representative available for those connecting with Virgin. There was no representative around for questions. Virgin America told me I would need to find an Alaska representative. I looked all over the terminal and finally found 2 at Gate 69A. They initially tried to help, but since it was almost 12 by then they were eager to leave for the night. They told me to go to Customer Service next door and someone would help me. I waited 10 minutes and no one showed up and the other workers left for the night. I had to resort to calling customer service. They informed me that I was rebooked for a 7.50am flight with Virgin America the next morning. I was never made aware of that or given options. They also would not give me a hotel claiming it was due to air traffic control and they were not responsible. So I got stuck at the airport for the night. The customer service was terrible. Honestly, I fly a lot. I had really liked flying with Alaska previously and was going to fly more with them. I even got their credit card. I had even talked with my friends about how I preferred Alaska, but after this experience I have changed my mind. I have some flights with some partner airlines coming up, but I no longer have a preference to fly with Alaska. I also will be changing credit cards in the near future. I no longer need to accumulate points with an airline I am not pleased with.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Los Angeles,Oct-17,3,3,3,,1,1,no
Alaska Airlines,3,Patrick Cuyler,20th October 2017,âœ… Verified Review | Edmonton to Portland via Seattle. My flight at 6am was cancelled and rescheduled to 1 pm. Then my 1 pm flight was cancelled as well and I was placed on a flight the next day that had an additional stop and got me to Portland more than 24 hours later than when I originally booked. The response from Alaska Airlines was not adequate enough in my opinion. I spent 45 min on the phone with them fixing this issue. I would not recommend flying Alaska Airlines to anyone. Many previous flights have been cancelled for me as well. Overall a poorly run company with poor customer service.,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Edmonton to Portland via Seattle,Oct-17,3,4,1,1,3,1,no

First they bumped us from premium when they downgraded our plane, then they moved my large child onto my lap and I was forced to buy a new ticket at last minute prices (4x what I originally paid). Then they boarded and we sat on the runway forever before they returned to the gate to let someone on. How important did that person think they were. If they were sick or something I'd be happy to accommodate them but they seemed decidedly not in special circumstances, then we sat again for 20 minutes. By the time we took off we were supposed to have landed. My poor daughter was worked by the stress of the situation and I ran out of snacks and tricks.

Alaska Airlines,1,Jason Kreitzer,9th October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | New York to Lihue via Seattle. I booked a trip to Hawaii on Alaska almost 1 year before the flight date. This week, Alaska decided to change all of their flights, turning what would have been an 11 hour trip to New york into a 20+ hour trip with an overnight layover. I am flying with a 9 year old. When I called two days ago the agent had offered to fix my trip by routing us from Ogg->LAX->JFK. I called back today (2 days later) to take them up on that offer, and the agent said she would be unable to do that, and that I'd have to buy a whole new ticket. This is ridiculous on multiple levels. First, I paid $3000 for the voucher I used, which was donated by an Alaska executive at a Parkinson's charity auction. I am happy to track down and document all the details of that. Second, It is the airline schedule change that is causing this issue. Third, Alaska Airlines offered me this remedy two days ago, which was not ideal, and are now retracting that offer. Frankly, I'm speechless. This is the worst customer service experience I've had in a long time. Probably ever. And this is just the return flight. For the outgoing flight, they've change the schedule so that my connection now departs before I arrive. There is another flight from JFK (rather than Newark) that would solve this issue, but they are unwilling to make that change, due to some technicality in their system -- even though these airports are 20miles apart.

First our plane was late. Arrived at PDX alniatcan hour late. Then had maintenance issues, somleft Oregon line an hour late. Everything seemed fine, but then just as we were going to be landing in Santa Barbara, tee were diverted to Fresno for sone issue with a stabilizer and needed a longer runway. I was a bit freaked, but we landed safely in Fresno. All were taken off the plane, and were in Fresno for about an hour. Were given food vouchers and snacks. Thankfully it turned out it was not a stabilizer, but the computer and plane were not synched correctly and was easily fixed. We were in Santa Barbara after this in a half hour.

I had 15 minutes to get to my gate before boarding started which was unbelievably far away. Arrived at Gate C and sent me to gate N for which you have an underground shuttle. Once I arrived at my ticketed gate I found they move to back to gate C on the other side of the airport. Had to run like a fool and barely made it at the cost of running around people. All the ""smiles"" from flight crew don't over ride the lack of communication and help by gate personnel when simply said ""your gate was moved - better hurry only 10 minutes till doors close"". Note to gate desk personnel - when you see a boarding pass was issued then changed with the gate you are in charge of, maybe you can be a little more helpful. And note to exit staff, maybe update passengers of connecting gate changes as they leave the plane. Seems like the 1st rule in transportation. Help your customers find their destination when you make a change or issue a incorrect boarding pass.

Alaska Airlines,2,C Saunders,14th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | We flew from Saint Louis to Anchorage with Alaska Airlines. One of our bags did not make it on the plane in Seattle. When we arrived to Anchorage, we realized it did not arrive. The luggage service told us they did not put the suitcase on in Seattle because the ""plane was too heavy"". They offered a $25 discount on future travel! They could not tell us when our luggage would arrive, despite at least 10 flights a day from Seattle to Anchorage. Furthermore, they could not tell us when we would receive a bag. Finally, they could not tell us what kind of allowance we could have to purchase gear needed for fishing which was in our bag. To make matters worse, the airline never communicated with us via phone to provide updates. The following morning, almost 24 hours later, the bag had not arrived. We were then informed initially that it would be on a train, then on a bus to Seward, 2.5 hours from Anchorage. The bag was then delivered to a random Bed and Breakfast in Seward. After multiple phone calls and hours spent, the bag was located and delivered to our lodge approximately 30 hours after arrival.

Oh it will takes up to 14 days to get that back sir. So not only did we loose our great seats in our this money till it's returned on there accord.

FC ticket allows use of AL lounge at PDX (none at MCI), which was OK. FC cabin has 12 comfortable seats with power outlets and dedicated flight attendant. Free Gogoinflight service is barely satisfactory. Service, food and drinks were all good on both legs. Excellent FC check in service at both ends.

This trip we fully boarded on time and at departure time the pilot announced that the plane wasn't fueled yet and was waiting on a fuel truck. 40 minutes later one showed up.

Two hours before the flight, I get an e-mail saying ""Sorry, your flight has been canceled."" However, the e-mail, ios app, and online all showed the same exact itinerary. It wasn't until I arrived at Portland did everything update to show that my PDX-RNO flight was completely canceled. I was auto-booked for a flight the next day. Not only is that terrible, but the lady at the counter was able to fit me into the last seat on a flight that afternoon, which means the auto-booking system isn't helpful. I had to sit in Portland twiddling my thumbs for 8 hours, and it was awful. Here's the redeeming qualities of Alaska Airlines, the rep gave me some vouchers for food and snacks, and discount codes for my next booking. Not a worthy trade to me, but at least they were apologetic and tried to remedy the situation as best they could. Like I said, this was my only bad experience with Alaska so I won't swear them off for that. Except for the flight attendant that skipped over me for a drink.

They said if we arrived 2 hours earlier we could request a gate pass. So on the day of the departure we arrived early and found out that they wouldn't give us one. No explanation. So I had to carry the car seat, my luggage, and have my 2 year old running behind me to make it through the tsa screening and walk all around to find our gate.

Alaska Airlines,9,S Fallon,7th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Detroit to Seattle. Phenomenal service, excellent food. This is my first time flying Alaska, and I chose them because they're partners with Virgin, it was my best flight in a quite a while. This plane was older and the interior was showing wear, so I was a little concerned about what to expect - worry not, you're in for a top notch experience with Alaska Airlines. Service was super friendly and attentive, meals were designed by Seattle chef Tom Douglas (I skipped the entree & dessert, so I can't comment on that) but the salad was very nice, dinner smelled wonderful (pesto), dessert was gorgeous, and the beverages never stopped flowing. I've read reviews that Alaska's first class chairs are uncomfortable due to pitch, I didn't find this to be the case - I found them very comfy, but this was only a 4-5 hour flight. The only slight negative was I had planned to work in-flight and the barely there internet connection made that impossible - they use GoGo and it runs $24 for an in flight pass. I'm not sure if the wifi problems were a GoGo issue, a hardware issue, or due to some other factor. I didn't mind though, it was nice to take a break and enjoy some on board entertainment. Even better - the cost for this first class nonstop flight was only around $100 more than the next best option - an economy carrier with seating headaches, no meal service, and connections amounting to twice the travel time!

As busy as my gate agent was she worked with 3 others to get my flight from Seattle to Anchorage bumped up shortening my layover. They told me to get on standby in Portland asap to avoid this 6 hour layover. On Memorial Day I got the last seat.

Alaska Airlines,10,B Redman,16th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | A direct return flight to Seattle from Boston. Both ways were on time, which is generally regarded as mission impossible in the Boston Logan airport - no idea how they manage to pull it. The return flight landed half an hour early which was very much appreciated, considering that it was almost midnight. Alaska guarantees that the bags are delivered to the carousel 20 minutes from the moment the disembarkation starts, both times it was faster than that. Drinks were served 3 times during the 5 and half hour flight. The selection of meals for purchase was generally so so, but no demerit points for that since it's expected of all airlines. They did give a free cookie. Ample space between seats. The wifi was sluggish at times, but the entertainment package was fine. The crew were efficient and polite. But it's the service that made me write the review making sure the airline gets a deserved praise. After the outbound flight, our bag was nowhere to be found. We filed a report while a very patient and nice customer service lady told us what may be happening. She also said that the bag may arrive while we are filing the report as it may have been misdirected elsewhere in the airport. This is exactly what happened. Her apologetic and helpful attitude was already compensating for the inconvenience. However, we were given $50 discount off the next flight. On the flight back, something started dripping on me from above. It turned out some kind of saline solution from another passenger's bag (makes me happy that they prohibit carrying acids and dangerous chemicals!). The crew rushed with napkins, cleaned everything up, made sure the dripping stopped within minutes, and we got all the alcohol and the food for free. This is how the airline service is meant to be.

I was moved to First and sat next to a young lady who works for Alaska. We spoke about a number of subjects and I inquired about her time with the airline. She said she is very pleased to be with them in the reservations department. I told her I am a Gold member and really enjoy the flights I have had these past seven years.

I can't even post a review on alaskalistens because the form doesn't recognize my itinerary. I booked thru Alaska Airlines and they put me on Virgin America for the SFO to LAX leg. When I got to SFO they couldn't book my luggage to Mexico. The counter agent observed or booking was stupid. We told him Alaska booked it this way. First leg ended in LAX, point to point. So our luggage could book thru. After three levels of supervisor and 45 minutes the ticket agent figured a way to get the luggage to Mexico but advised us to check in Mexico to avoid the issue returning. No agent in Mexico would take responsibility for the issue. As a consequence when we got to LAX on the return we had to shelp our bags from terminal 6 (Alaska) to terminal (3) Virgin to recheck them in. Took so long we missed our flight to San Francisco. We are long time Alaska users with a credit card and a mileage plan. Very disappointed. If they try to put you on Virgin for one leg be forewarned that they haven't worked out all the kinks is the merger.

Their service and staff, flight attendants are very nice and helpful. Entertainment can be good depending on which aircraft you go on. If you are on a flight longer than 3.5 hours, then you can rent their entertainment tablet for around $8 or $10. This includes free movies and games. If your flight is under that, then bring your own device and download the Gogo app before departing. You will be able to watch free movies if your airline has wifi. It's great that they have power outlets. Wifi is expensive at $16. You don't have to purchase wifi in order to watch entertainment on your device.

Prior to boarding we took in the Alaska Boardroom and enjoyed our time there. We flew in the Premium Economy section and had no complaints. The food was fine as was the service. The aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth. Upon landing in Kona we went to pick up our bags but as luck would have it, ours and 40 other folks did not have any! As it turned out, these bags were left in Anchorage. Something to do with weight, headwinds or whatever. This was not something that we expected and we were not pleased but Alaska did try to meet our needs somewhat. We were offered either a coupon for $100 off a future ticket or 4 thousand miles on our Mileage Plan. I took the miles as did my wife. Our luggage was delivered the next afternoon. There were some folks who were quite upset over this and I felt bad for the employees having to try to meet their needs. Our stay in Kona was not good due to sickness for the entire 11 days but I must say it was a beautiful place, we plan to return and stay where we were this time. Kona is not a bad place to be sick I must admit! Our return trip went through Seattle and again we were in P/E section. Everything was fine, again a great crew, clean plane and wonderful service.

I tried to do something awesome for my mom since it was her birthday and her first time to Hawaii so I upgraded our seats to ""premium"". Premium seats are terrible for the following reasons: If I can't store my carry on under the seat in front of me because it's a row behind first class which only has 2 seats then the seat isn't premium. If I have the ""first class curtain"" hanging in my lap and in my face every time someone walks through it then it's not a premium seat. If I have to go from row 7 all the way to the back of the plane to the lavatory, then the seat isn't premium. If it says I get chocolates, almonds & cranberries & what I get is 1 square of dark chocolate, a snack size bag of blue almonds (approximately $0.50) and a snack size bag of ocean spray cranberries (approximately $0.50) then it's not premium. If it says to power up with a power outlet at every seat but every seat on the whole plane has one including the regular fare seats then it's not premium. When it say complimentary drinks but the attendant comes by once the whole flight that's not premium. When it says I can recline but the seats only go back as far as the normal seats then it's not premium.

I wasn't that happy, but Alaska Airlines kept us informed and boarded us as quickly as possible. Soon after the plane took off, they began the service. The snacks were good and they came around with drinks three times during the flight. I ordered one of their Signature fruit and cheese platters and I was shocked about how good it was. The flight attendants were really kind and friendly and seemed like that they loved their jobs. One thing I wasn't too happy about was that their IFE had a limited selection of programs and that you had to download this terrible app to use it.

I get that stuff happens but doing all you can to fix a wrong is appreciated and good costumer service. Alaska Airlines staff repeatedly told me it wasn't their fault but I'm the customer and it wasn't my fault either. If you provide a service sub par make it right and don't make a costumer feel like it was their mistake or that they have to pay for a mistake they didn't cause. I paid for a hotel and would have had to pay too much to get on the next flight out. That is unreasonable.

Our gate was switched twice, a sign of what was to come. As was the hard of hearing old man that the gate staff refused to help. The 8pm flight was delayed so badly that it became clear that we would miss our connection in Seattle. The bumbling idiots at the ticket counter couldn't figure out a solution to this issue, since their system doesn't link with better airlines (such as Jetblue). They put us up in a hotel for the night with the promise of a non-stop first class, 6:15am flight (to Newark, when our car was at JFK). Midway through the flight, we are diverted to Pittsburg, where we were trapped on the plane for 3 hours. After an announcement that we were going to Baltimore next, we took off for Newark, landing at 7:30pm . From 6:15am to 7:30, we were offered one fruit plate and some small snacks.

From Kona to Seattle they had the family split up including our 5 year old. They did not care at all (that's the way flights work she said they have to make money). Then the flight attendant prosseded to give my 5 year old pop every time he would ask but my wife and I were not sitting in same row and could not see. My wife got to sit beside 2 people that had to use belt extensions - it was fun for her. When we got to Seattle they had seats for us - one for me but the kids and wife they oversold. They know when you book flights how old people are so the idea of splitting up a mother or father and a 5 year old is ridiculous.

Alaska Airlines,3,R Matthews,13th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Seattle to Los Angeles. Alaska Airlines has gotten better over the years but still has a ways to go. Many of their flights are still late and they generally do an awful job of updating the electronic screens at the gates. The screen will say a flight is boarding in 5 minutes when there isn't even a plane at the gate. It's also comical how Alaska charges most of their passengers to check a bag but then offers to do it for free as nearly every flight has issues with overhead bin space. So if you're flying Alaska check in online and choose zero bags to check. A screen or two later Alaska will usually offer to let you check your carry-on for free. And even if they don't, they almost certainly will offer to do so at the gate. Why not offer a free checked bag to everyone if you're going to offer that anyway? It's not fair to those who paid to check their bags. On the plus side their newest planes (the ""next gen"" 737-800 and -900) have more generous legroom and power at your seat. On the downside you have to use your own device for inflight entertainment. Alaska could learn something from Virgin American (which they now own). They do offer free (for now) streaming shows over WiFi but it's cumbersome, buggy, and you have to click past several screens trying to sell you GoGo inflight WiFi. While they offer a decent selection of paid food and beverages they have only a single food and beverage cart for the entire plane and a 737-900 is a long plane. So it takes something like 45 minutes for the service to work its way from the front to the back. But my biggest complaint about Alaska is they have many flights that are chronically late, yet they refuse to change the scheduled times. Even the flight crews have no explanation why they don't change the scheduled times. Southwest flies many of the same routes and puts Alaska to shame with their on-time record on those flights. And if anything goes wrong, like bad weather (we recently had snow in Seattle, for example) look out as Alaska turns into total chaos - especially at SeaTac. Wait times exceed one hour for calling them, lines stretch way down the hall from their customer service counters, their website falls on its face from the load, etc. And if you do stand in line for hours trying to rebook your cancelled, or infinitely delayed, flight, you're usually offered nothing useful and a joke of a customer care package. Basically they just seem not to care as they already have your money. Alaska charges at least $125 to make any changes to most flights and it's often horrifically expensive if you have to make a last minute change. This is in stark contrast to Southwest that charges no penalties for changes. Alaska's boarding is annoying with several ""tiers"" of preboarding which often amounts to at least a third of the plane with many of those people still blocking the aisles once they start general boarding. Again, Southwest is a far more pleasant and efficient experience. But airlines like United are even worse in this regard. Overall, for west coast travel I often have my pick of Southwest, Virgin America, Alaska, Delta, and United. And I try to book flights in that order of priority. Alaska is my third choice after Southwest and Virgin.",Boeing 737-900,Business,Economy Class,Seattle to Los Angeles,Feb-17,4,2,3,1,1,3,no

I flew with a certified service animal from Dallas to Fairbanks via Seattle. On the plane from Dallas to Seattle my service animal (a large dog) were asked to deboard because they had sold the seat next to me. Both the gate agent and the reservations agent I spoke with encouraged me to buy an extra seat on the Seattle to Fairbanks flight to ensure there was room and stated a refund would be issued with no problems if there were open seats left on the flight. Upon calling for my refund because there were open seats, the customer care agent was extremely rude, said they would refund it only this once and never do that again.

The night before there was some snow but by the time we were going to leave it was clear. So like a typical there needs to be clearing of the runways, de-icing of the planes, etc., but it appeared that not only did they not take care of this prior to us boarding, but as we were boarding they still told us that we were leaving on time. Even after sitting on the plane 25 minutes after we were supposed to leave, we were finally told we were going to have to pull out on the side of the runway and wait another 40 minutes to de-ice and wait for the plane's oil to warm up. I understand that all these things need to happen and sometimes there's issues, it's just the poor preparation and the lack of communication that makes this service dissatisfying.

Had a great time in Mexico, then the flight out of Mexico was delayed for no reason. We were able to upgrade to exit row#6.

We landed in LA, sat on plane for 45 minutes while exit door was worked on only to be told we would be exiting from back of plane.

At that time I requested that if they were going to do the same flying back from there to Los Angeles to inform me then so I can change plans and confirmed that they wouldn't. Later they called me and said that they had equipment change so they have to downgrade me again on the return flight. Amazing, by then too late to have last minute changes during Christmas times. So I called and asked to at least put my name on the upgrade list in case they had room and they guaranteed that once at the airport I had to give my name again and they put my family on number 16 through 20 for waiting list.

Remember the old days when you were told several times during the flight what was going on? Last night we experience turbulence on the flight and the captain announced to us more than once that it was going to be intermittent throughout the flight and why, jet stream winds that we were going through and not to worry as it would not get worse than what we were experiencing. He was very reassuring and kind. Also, when do you have the cockpit crew stand with the flight attendants as you are leaving the cabin to greet passengers? Extremely impressed! The absolute only negative is that the planes are a little old and the seats are not that comfortable, but each seat has an electrical plug and there is wifi on the airplane.

To my surprise not only am I required to select seats, their were no seating options that keeps our family together without an additional fee. This change was not mention in the Email. In fact the email list in detail the original seating selections under ""updated flight information"". Now this 5 hour flight only have options that puts all 4 of us in middle seats scattered all over the airplane. I called Alaska Airlines representative who instructed me to call American Airlines. American Airlines said to contact the company I booked the flight with. I booked this trip with Alaska Airlines and therefore I expected them to fix this problem. It's very important to us that our family is seated together on our flight. Less than 24 hours before the trip we cant get a refund and we can't book a new trip without outrageous cost, so we flew without all of us being seated together. This was a very unpleasant way to start our vacation. We contacted Alaska Airlines and they apologized for the inconvenience and added ""Unfortunately, our Customer Care department only handles post flight situations on Alaska Airlines operated flights.

Alaska Airlines,2,William Wagner,15th November 2016,"I was to fly this airline from Santa Rosa to Los Angeles on Nov 13th. The flight was canceled do to weather. Because I had a flight back to Germany at 3 pm that day, I needed to get to LA. They rebooked me from SFO to LAX. I paid 25 dollars for a Bus company to get to SFO from Santa Rosa. When I got there I had to repay a baggage fee I already paid Alaskan Airlines. I got in. Now I got back and I am trying to get reimbursed for the bus fee and the extra bag fee. After waiting 30 minutes to get to the customer care. I was told they would reimburse my bag fee, but not the bus fee or any other fee I incurred. Not happy with their approach to this, nor the ladies attitude on the phone. I expected to be treated fairly. I paid a high price for the ticket to fly out of Santa Rosa. I could have booked the flight that I eventually took and paid 150 Dollars less. I know this cancellation was weather related. But I would have expected the airlines to pay a bill for 25 Dollars to help the excess cost that I had to take upon myself because of this situation.

Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,1st November 2016,"Anchorage to Nashville via Seattle. Another great trip with Alaska Airlines. The flight down to SEA was on their Combi 400 the cargo / passenger plane. Nice flight with a great seatmate. Arrival was early as it was a redeye. Spent some quality time at the Boardroom as I usually do - no issues there. I was bumped up to First on the leg to BNA. The crew and service was great, no problems noted. I arrived on time and thanked the crewmembers for the great service. The return to ANC was a bit unusual for me this time as I flew to SEA spent the night and then departed the next morning. The flight began about 30 minutes late due to storm issues in Seattle which caused some backup in the system but it was no problem on my end. The flight was quite bumpy in parts but no problems. The service was great as was the food. Arriving in SEA I slepped over to the fine USO located there and spent the evening talking with the outstanding staff and various Soldiers, Sailors, Marines and Airmen who were enjoying the hospitality as I was. I got to my 8:30 AM flight and had the pleasure of sitting next to a fine Alaska attendant who was heading back to the Greatland. As I was departing the aircraft in ANC she noticed my wallet which had departed my pocket somehow and got it back to me. My only issue was at baggage claim. I watched the clock countdown and my bag got there in 21 minutes. As this was not the 20 minutes they strive for I grabbed my bag and went to get my 2500 miles added to my account. The young lady working there said they had made it as they did not go by the time which was at the claim area they go by another clock apparently which us passengers are not aware of. The lady in front of me was not pleased and neither was I. I told her as a Gold member this was the first time I had run into this issue and it sort of sounded like false advertising. I decided to not raise hell as I was tired and needed to get on the road home.

If you can contact them they will blame Bank of America who will in turn say they only provide information to Alaska on the ""billing cycle"" so if that does not come around before 90 days I do not get the bonus mileage.

Alaska Airlines,1,Jessica Berg,7th September 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Newark to Yakima. Alaska Airlines is awful. I've primarily flown with them for the past 25 years and they've been going downhill. They don't allow passengers on board during the boarding time, close doors early at airports, charge exorbitant fees for luggage (food, liquor, etc). They tell people to go to the customer service desk, which isn't even open, don't give options when they won't allow you on a flight that they've randomly decided you can't board because they've closed the doors early, and offer you a 50$ refund when you need to rent a car to dive over 4 hours because of it. They don't offer hotel stays, free luggage, or anything. This has gone from being the best airline, to being the worst airline, over the last 25 years. They have a ""20 minute"" baggage guarantee, which always takes longer and they never honor. They charge 100$ for a 20 min flight because they're the only airline that flies out of my small town.

Alaska Airlines,4,David Eldridge,1st August 2016,"Los Angeles to Puerto Vallarta. I'm going to say Alaska Airlines 1st class is not worth the money for a number of reasons. Here's my observations from Seat 4D. No immediate service. No drinks/snacks as people are boarding. A usual perk of 1st. Personal entertainment devices aren't always available. (Even when they say you have your own). There is no difference in extra leg room between 1st and economy plus. Just 2 seats a row instead of 3, which is nice, but not for the price difference. Service onboard is not first class quality when compared to Delta, Virgin, Air New Zealand (to name a few). Not even close. Food, drinks, services just not that special. Alaska sells off vacant 1st class seats at the last moment if they're available for $50. This is painful. Great for the person who gets a $1000 seat for $50 - not good when you pay a premium for peace and quiet. But, it explains why they don't care about good service in 1st. Alaska needs to step it up. A ""wider"" seat just isn't worth the premium price.",,Family Leisure,First Class,LAX to PVR,Aug-16,3,2,2,1,3,2,no

Alaska Airlines,6,I Chandramouli,19th July 2016,"AS 3380, Portland - San Jose, operated by Skywest. Check in at PDX was extremely smooth and efficient, so we had an hour to spare before boarding. Boarding was out of the cramped concourse A and began 10 minutes late with no explanation. Once aboard, the E175 was in good condition and was extremely spacious, even more so than the 737 on the outbound flight, although the overhead bins were small. A weight balance issue resulted in several passengers in the last few rows having to move forward, this took a while as FA's had to recruit volunteers and people were stubborn. Fortunately, we still managed to push back within 15 minutes of scheduled departure and were airborne after a short taxi. Cabin crew were nice, but they could have managed the timing of the short flight better. They spent the first half of the flight chatting in the galley. A small snack with the beverage was a nice touch, but it didn't start until halfway through the flight. Literally right after they finished the beverage service, a flight attendant came through with a trash bag when most people were not even finished, so most had to sit with trash on their traytables while the FA's resumed chatting in the galley. They had more than enough time to get the service done as the FA's on the outbound leg easily served an aircraft twice the size and we still had 20 minutes after the service during cruise. Finally, during final approach, they realized we needed them to collect the rubbish and did so. We landed in San Jose 20 minutes ahead of schedule, and they made sure to brag about Alaska's on-time performance flightstats award. Overall, AS will get you from Point A to B reliably with decent crew and good value, but they shouldn't sell themselves as a major legacy airline when they are really just a decent budget airline. While AS is certainly not bad, I usually try to book with Jetblue or Virgin America due to their combination of a low fare with great service.

Check in at SJC was a bit chaotic as there was little signage or explanation of the procedure for those who had checked in online. This created a mass of confused people looking for the bag drop. Once past security, the gate agent proceeded to yell all of the boarding groups instead of just using the PA. This was a bit bizarre since she used it for a couple of other announcements. Although old, the B737-400 was in decent condition for its age. Only issue in that respect was that my armrest was loose. Seat pitch was reasonable for someone who is 6'0"", especially considering the short duration of flight. We departed on time, but the aircraft PA volume was so low that passengers could barely hear announcements. Cabin crew also failed to enforce important safety regulations such as windowshades being drawn up for takeoff and landing. (So that people can easily see out in case of an evacuation). However, they did manage the short flight time extremely well regarding the beverage service. They all were extremely polite and genuine. This genuine caring among its cabin crews is one of Alaska's major strengths. We landed on time in PDX with the 20-minute baggage guarentee being met. Overall a nice short hop.

Prior to departure we were in the PDX Alaska Board Room (paid membership). The place was dirty. Boarding was slow, mainly because there seems to have been only one gate agent working a full flight. As a result, we pushed back about 15 minutes late. The gate agent acted as though we were a bother to her - a real attitude issue. The four FA's working the flight were more interested in chatting with each other and constantly checking their iPhones, than interacting with passengers. This was particularly true later in the flight when the FA's gathered in the forward galley for a chat-fest. Our seating area was filthy, with coffee stains and food crumbs on the tray tables and the area between the seats The IFE on Alaska is woefully inadequate; in 1st, you are offered a DigEPlayer (like a small tablet) preloaded with content. Your other choice is to stream content on your own device, but to do so, you must pay for it. This is inferior to the AVOD on American and Delta that is complimentary in 1st. First class catering (lunch) was a joke - a warm turkey sandwich. It was the one and only option. The worst part of the trip was the seating on the Boeing 737-900. First off, the 737-800/900 seat pitch on Alaska is less than on Delta and far less than on American. Moreover, the first class seats would not recline.

I will take the 2500 miles and add it to my account. Thanks Alaska for your great service, fine planes and crews and attitude!",,Family Leisure,First Class,ANC to LAS via SEA,Jan-16,5,5,5,5,4,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Patricia Bader,16th January 2016,"Newark to Seattle with Alaska Airlines, and the flights were perfect. The staff could not do enough for us, and it reminded me of the old days when flying you were treated with respect and kindness. The food was good and the plane was immaculate.

Alaska Airlines,1,Nicole Nagamine,12th January 2016,"This was the first time that I was flying on Alaska Airlines. The first flight from Kahului was fine but when I arrived in San Diego it was horrible. After having a six hour layover in San Diego, turns out that the flight that I had been waiting for had a mechanical error and they ended up sending a smaller plane instead. I almost didn't have a seat because the gate agent said that I didn't check in early enough to have my seat and I and 11 other people who also paid for a seat were basically on standby. The worst thing was, I checked in the day before so how dare they tell me that I didn't check in early enough to get a seat. And the seat that I had originally booked, that said it was my confirmed seat, was given to the first person on the wait list. To anybody who is thinking of flying Alaska, don't. This was the worst flight experience I had ever had and I'm a frequent flyer.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,OGG to SLC via SAN,Jan-16,2,2,,,1,2,no
Alaska Airlines,10,Omar Khan,5th January 2016,"Seattle to Los Angeles, and this was my first experience flying with Alaska Airlines, and overall it was an excellent experience. The plane was clean and comfortable (it was one of the newest planes in the Alaska Airlines fleet, and our pilot half-jokingly reminded us to keep it clean as a result!), and the flight attendants were great. The inflight entertainment system worked really well with my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S6), and it was great having chargers with each seat, so that I didn't drain my battery life while watching TV shows or movies during the flight. It's also nice to have a number of free viewing options, along with full WiFi and additional movie/TV show options available (for an extra fee). I have nothing bad to say about my first Alaska Airlines experience, and do plan on flying with them again in the future.",Boeing 737-900,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SEA to LAX,Nov-15,5,5,4,5,4,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Paul Spencer,1st January 2016,"Excellent service as usual from Seattle to San Diego. Whenever there is an opportunity to fly Alaska we do so even if the fare is not the cheapest because the service experience is always far superior to the other airlines. Virgin America is great too but has limited destinations - so therefore Alaska, together with their mileage program, is always the preference. They were serving a red wine by Browne Vineyards not the usual cheap stuff that other airlines serve - even in international biz class.",Boeing 737,Family Leisure,First Class,SEA to SAN,Dec-15,5,5,4,,5,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,14th December 2015,"This was my eleventh and final trip this year. As a retired guy I have plenty of time on my hands, so I check out various airline vacation deals. I noticed a great deal to Las Vegas with Alaska Vacations. Departing on Monday, we flew to Portland on a daylight flight. The crew, plane and service was just fine all the way around. Landing at PDX we noticed how much rain the area had been receiving - what a mess. The airport was fine. We were there about an hour before we departed to the land of Lost Wages. The pilot informed us that the climb out may be a bit on the bumpy side and we had to stay at a lower altitude the entire way due to upper level turbulence. It was not bad at all. On our return, our departure flight was to be a bit on the bumpy side but we had been warned of this. Just prior to departing the pilot came out and talked to us about his 26 years of experience with Alaska and how much he, his co-pilot and crew appreciated our flying with them. I have seen this a couple of other times and I was impressed. The flight to SEA was great. Our departing Seattle was expected to be rough and we were informed that we would climb out at a lower altitude for some distance due to expected rough air, not bad though. We were on a new 737-900 which had been in service for about six weeks, still had the new plane smell. Everything worked great - the service, the food, our luggage arriving with us was a bonus as I was fairly certain it might not. All in all, the flights were great, the Vacation package was great pricewise and above all, Alaska continued to provide what I have come to expect, ""Service With Pride"".",Boeing 737-800/900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,ANC to LAS via PDX/SEA,Dec-15,4,5,5,4,5,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,29th November 2015,"My son and I flew down to SDF from ANC via ORD during Thanksgiving. I cannot say that ORD was fun that is for sure as they had a huge snowstorm on Saturday and it was a mess. The flight down on Alaska Airlines was fine as my son and I were bumped up to First. The service was great, the crew members were professional and caring. Everyone just wanted to sleep and that was fine with me as well. We arrived a bit early and had to wait awhile for our gate but no problem. We had a few hours to kill so we ate at Wolfgang P. and that was quite good. I enjoyed a breakfast Pizza. The flight to SDF was on American Air E-175. Decent overall, no complaints. Our return to ANC was uneventful for the most part. The Alaska Airlines flight departed on time from ORD. The flight had us in First again and the service was great. I did not eat the food as I had something prior to boarding. I watched a movie and then tried to watch a second one but my digiplayer froze up. There was a call for any medical persons on board as a young lady had a heart issue. It turned out to be fine, she was checked out by medics when we landed in Anchorage and did not have any further problems. All in all another series of great flights on Alaska Airlines. Fine, clean planes crewed by professionals who cared for their passengers - a first rate job! Thanks!",Boeing 737-800 / E175,Family Leisure,First Class,ANC to SDF via ORD,Nov-15,5,5,,3,5,4,yes

There were mechanical issues that delayed the plane for a little over 2 hours. The Captain Hendricks the issues to the passengers in a friendly, concise and comforting manner. He kept us updated throughout the repair process. His reassuring manner relaxed me and helped to keep everyone calm and in good spirits even though we had to disembark the plane for a time period. I want to also thank Alaska Airlines for the food voucher and for the voucher for a future flight.

Alaska Airlines,10,Susan James,16th November 2015,Alaska Airlines has great domestic service. I fly them every time to Seattle and anywhere else if I can. The flight attendants are friendly. I use my miles and it is very easy. The airline provided complimentary beer or wine which is nice. I like the fact they would give us updates or the pilot would tell us weather conditions.

Alaska Airlines,2,Jamesa Marino,2nd November 2015,"Our flight #121 from Seattle to Anchorage was not only approx an hour and a half late but we also shared half the aircraft with a load of freight? To add insult to injury, the constant loud chatter of the stewardesses made it impossible to try to catch a few winks before our anticipated 1.30am arrival in Anchorage. The complete disregard for passenger comfort and well being was such a huge contrast to our prior experiences with Alaska Airlines which have consistently exceeded our expectations. As a result, we will not be travelling long distance with Alaska Airlines in future.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Anchorage,Oct-15,1,1,,,1,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,31st October 2015,"Returned last night from Seattle with Alaska Airlines after visiting my daughter there. The flights were fine in both directions. I had hoped to get bumped up to First, however, that did not happen. I was pleased with seat 8F down and 9F back. There is only so much the flight crews can do on redeye flights but I will say the flight crew on the way back to the Greatland was impressive as one of the passengers two rows up from me experienced some type of medical issue. Three of the four attendants worked with him and all went well upon our arrival. We were ontime and had snow waiting for us - how nice. My bag was about one minute late so I received my 2500 mile voucher. I informed some of the other passengers who were waiting with me and they too got miles. I read the review of the unhappy customer who flew to Mexico recently, I have to say that the issue of paying for anything in First Class is incorrect based on my experience. You will hear back from their Customer Service folks and they will do what it takes to make things right for you. I hope it does. Anyhow, I am pleased once again with Alaska and look forward to my next flying experience to Chicago at Thanksgiving.",Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,ANC to SEA,Oct-15,4,5,,,5,5,yes

From being told that my seat was sold to a different person and I'd have to rebook a different day to getting to an Alaska Airlines flight and getting seated fast and being appreciated for being in the military, it's refreshing to have such a nice and well trained staff that suits in customers in every way possible. Thank you",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Seattle,Oct-15,4,5,3,4,5,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,K Voccia,22nd October 2015,"The seats were uncomfortable, barely reclined and featured an ""innovative"" design to provide 3"" of leg room. I'm tall and I would expect 1st class to provide extra leg room. Not on Alaska Airlines. My knees were crushed for a good part of the flight. Food, other than soft drinks all other beverages cost. Nothing was complimentary. The meal was a TexMex Salad that was mostly a pile of lettuce with cheese on top. A prepackaged cookie was thrown in. Coach had options better than First class. Upon asking for some fruit from coach I was told ""we'll see"" and it was going to cost me extra. Coffee was never offered and upon asking I was told maybe they had some in coach but they were out. Little to no complimentary inflight entertainment. That was going to cost too. As soon as we were over Mexican airspace the whole system went dead. No wifi. Not even when flying in American airspace. If it was offered, as apparently it was on some flights, it was going to cost. After meal service, I couldn't get a even a small bag of pretzels. No effort was made to make the flight more comfortable or to provide any alternative food. The crew was friendly enough but seemed inexperienced in providing any first class service. Oddly the flight began with an announcement from the pilot (male) on how attractive the all female flight crew was. I felt as if I had stepped back 50 years. Though minor, it wasn't appropriate or professional. My expectations for first class aren't all that high. A comfortable seat, plenty of leg room, complimentary beverages (inc wine), somewhat of a more substantial meal than you would receive in coach and at the very least a flight crew that tried to make your flight as pleasant as possible. Alaska Airlines provided non of these. No blanket or pillow, nothing to read - having to beg for coffee? And above all else I conveyed this info to Alaska Corporate/Customer Care. Nothing from them with even a hint they might want to retain a customer. If you are going to spend the extra money to arrive refreshed via flying first class, heed my advice, find another airline. I've never been disappointed by Virgin America. United, which is doing the bare minimum at least is providing the bare minimum.

Most everything went well with small exceptions. The flight crews did their jobs well, professionally, and with great attitudes. The flight back up to Anchorage had to stay at a lower altitude due to rough air however the pilot informed us of this just prior to lift off. All in all it was fine. The meal on the flight from Raleigh was quite tasty and desert was too.

Flying from Anchorage to Seattle is about 4 hours of absolute misery. The seats are tiny and hard. I was miserable after a couple of hours. Staff sighs snarky, rude and I don't give a damn! I had the beverage cart slam into my shoulder and the crew member said ""stay out of the aisle. "" I might add that there were 3 larger people in this row.

I was very pleased that they were able to give us a row. The seats were the most comfortable coach seats I've sat in. We're both a little tall, my husband is 6'3"", and he had enough room to stretch his legs out in front of him without his knees touching. The food offered was limited but good. The staff was the most friendly staff I've ever encountered flying in 25 years. Our flights were on time. They arrived a bit early at the destination. The best part was the changing table in the bathroom. The prices were the best offered for the trip we shopped for too.

Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,14th October 2015,"Another wonderful trip on Alaska. The flight from ANC to SEA was great, the crew was excellent, flight was on time, all in all no complaints whatsoever. I was looking forward to the next flight, SEA to Raleigh as this was the first time Alaska flew there. They had a nice going away ceremony at the gate with all sorts of breakfast items, short speeches and a ribbon cutting as well. The aircraft we flew on was the special Russell Williams plane which I think is the 900 model of the 737. It was quite the arrival in RDU! Although it was raining upon our arrival, there were numerous television crews both outside and inside to catch shots of the plane, crew and passengers. The RDU folks that greeted us, (about 75 or so) lined up, gave each of us a welcome to Raleigh bag of goodies plus clapped and cheered for us. I was amazed at the welcome - Southern Hospitality at its best! The only downside was that our luggage did not get to the passengers within the 20 minute guarantee. We each received the 2500 mile ticket to apply to our Mileage Plan - it's all good. The flight there was great by the way - 4 hours and 26 minutes with very little to gripe about. I believe that this route will do well as Raleigh is quite a nice destination, great airport and easy access to the car rental facilities/freeways.",Boeing 737-900,Business,First Class,ANC to RDU via SEA,Oct-15,5,5,5,4,4,4,yes

Alaska Airlines,10,Y Issa,1st October 2015,"When I rushed into the Boston airport wearing my ten-month-old son in a baby carrier and balancing a 55 pound anxious dog in an oversized crate on an unthinkably tiny luggage carrier (oh, Logan!) while my three-year-old clung to my thigh things were looking bleak. We were running late and I wanted to check in the dog while my husband dealt with the rest of the luggage, the rental, and a looming police officer. I was frazzled, but the Alaska Air staff spotted me right away and from then on our travel experience went smoothly. He really made sure that all the documents are checked as quick as possible and helped me take the dog crate through inspection. No one gave me any trouble with the dog, and we received a ticked assuring us that she was on the plane with us in the cargo. We found her safe and sound at our destination. All the while the staff member was entertaining and patient with my curious and slightly anxious daughter and assured me that he will take care that my husband gets on the plane in time as he was late returning the rental car, which he did. Everyone else working with Alaska Air was very courteous and attentive as well. Since we booked our seats late, we were not assigned to the same row, and with two small children this six hour flight could have turned very ugly if we were kept apart. The flight attendants took care of this issue right away and adjusted our seating so that we were in the same row (also thanks to two gracious gentlemen who agreed to switch their seats for us). The flight was long but comfortable, there was enough leg room even in the economy seats with snacks, drinks, and entertainment tablets making the long flight with tired kids tolerable. By the way the food was hot and delicious. Another nice touch came when we requested an entertainment tablet which was ten dollars per piece. The flight attendant noticed that my husband gave it to our daughter right away, so she gave him another one at no extra charge. No one harassed us when our kids were getting loud and impatient (which happened couple of times and ended very quickly, they are such good kids), and no one mentioned anything to me as I was nursing my little boy for most of the flight. I only have great things to say about the Alaska crew, they were so professional and compassionate.

Alaska Airlines,1,Susan Sopp,17th September 2015,"There have been numerous incidents with Alaska Airlines while my daughter has lived in Mammoth Lakes over the past 5 years. Today, Sept 15, 2015 my daughter, who had made her reservation weeks ago to fly down and go on vacation to a central coast beach town, got a text at 1 pm today notifying her that her flight had been cancelled. The next flight is tomorrow evening which would have her arriving at 7ish and we are due to be at our vacation destination tomorrow. If she took the offer for tomorrow we would be losing one nights hotel stay nonrefundable as there is a 48 hour deadline to cancel. She called Alaska Airlines to get her refund as now she has to drive down to LA by herself in order to make our plan work. She asked why the flight was cancelled, already knowing what they would say. Alaska Airlines go to phrase for cancelling flights is ""mechanical problems"" when the flight isn't full enough. Sure enough that is what she was told. I'm thinking really, there are 3 hours before the flight leaves LAX for Mammoth and there isn't a working plane available to be brought in? Well, of course there is nothing a passenger can do or say to change the ""I don't really care about you"" attitude that exists in this situation. It is really sad that this happens fairly often which proves to me that Alaska Airlines really doesn't care about this particular flight. I feel Alaska Airlines should perhaps not be flying in to Mammoth Lakes every day.

Alaska Airlines,6,Stephen G Sweet,31st August 2015,"Usually I am more than pleased with my trips on Alaska Airlines. I am a Gold member and will be again for this next year. The trip from Atlanta to Seattle was delayed due to a mechanical issue, starboard engine. This was fixed and we were about two hours late departing ATL. We were rebooked in ATL prior to finally leaving. This delay caused me to miss Flight 119 from SEA to ANC. I was rebooked on Flight 121 which is a Combi 400 737. Arrived at almost 3am and my luggage did not. None of the Atlanta folks luggage made it to ANC. I spoke with the luggage person and she said it would be sent out later on in the morning. I accepted this, not happy but it does happen. I called the MVP Gold customer service folks today to inquire about a partial refund for my flight as it had no 1st Class. She spoke to the accounting department and said I will get an $80 credit. The bottom line here is a customer who was not pleased overall, especially in regards to finding out about travel segments, some being refundable and some not. Oh well, live and learn.

When we arrived at the ticket counter at the airport in Albuquerque, we found out that it didn't open until an hour or so later. Surprisingly, two Alaska Airlines employees came out and helped us with our luggage tags since they use a special holder to attach to the luggage. As we were about to start boarding another employee approached us and asked if we would like to board using a new system that they were starting to use.

Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,13th August 2015,"Another series of fine flights with Alaska. Redeye to Seattle with a fine crew. Service was good. Plane was clean and on time. We had one unusual thing happen - a person apparently acted out in some manner towards a crew member right after we pulled back from the gate. We then returned to the gate and this ""gentleman"" was escorted off our plane. After that excitement we were off with no further issues. Upon landing at SeaTac I made my way eventually to the Boardroom where I enjoyed coffee and rolls, caught up on news and relaxed. The flight to ATL went fine. Again, plane was clean, crew was great and appeared quite professional in all regards. The return leg went fine. The pilot on the outbound leg to Seattle informed us of some possible rough air coming up over the St Louis area which folks appreciated. The food I ate was decent and the wine was enjoyable as well. The final leg back up to Anchorage was without any negatives. I actually caught some sleep which for me is unusual. Landed a few minutes early, luggage made it on time and then home to the Valley. All in all, a fine series of flights with great.",Boeing 737-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,ANC to ATL via SEA,Aug-15,4,4,4,4,5,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Ann Strang,6th August 2015,"Pleasant Flight, great staff, always try to fly with Alaska when I can, however I was not impressed with the food product. The first class service was great, but the food was not so good.",Boeing 737-400,Business,First Class,Oakland-Seattle,Jul-15,5,5,2,,5,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,Katy Montanez,26th July 2015,"Checked into Alaska Airlines at the Santa Rosa airport 2 hours before take off. The plane was 30 minutes late. Because they were late they decided to rush boarding and instead of the allotted 30 minutes it was more like 10-15 minutes. My 70 year mom and dad were right behind us in security. My husband and I got through security and we were rushed to get on the plane. I told them there were 2 more behind us. They decided to just cut the line there and didn't let them board! To top it off I was worried about my 70 year old mom (she was upset and crying) so I asked the flight attendant about my mom and dad not being on the plane. She snapped at me that it was too bad, and that they probably weren't there on time. I responded that we checked into the airport 2 hours previously. She said rudely, 'so?'. My mom ended up having to fly out of her way north to Seattle and them back down to San Diego to make it in time. Horrible airline, insensitive staff, rude, and couldn't care less about their customers and how they treat then.",,Business,Economy Class,Santa Rosa to San Diego,Jul-15,2,1,1,,1,1,no

Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen Sweet,15th July 2015,"Flew down to Louisville from Anchorage with a stop at ORD on the way. Bumped up to First again which was nice. Crew was great, plane clean and on time. I found nothing to complain about and arrived relaxed and pleased with the service. O'Hare airport in Chicago was a zoo. It was as crowded and noisy as Atlanta always seems to be. I went to the American Admirals Club and mellowed out for a few hours - fine service there and the views of the aircraft was a plus. Flight to SDF on American Eagle was fine - the E-175 they use was quite a nice aircraft for this short trip, great views from the large windows on board. The return trip back to ANC began again at SDF to ORD, same plane as above, fine service, nice crew etc. I was routed to Portland from Chicago this time. All went well, I was seated in economy and had no complaints. I purchased the movie viewer and was well entertained. Great service too. The flight to ANC was near perfect. Only problem encountered was that our luggage was about thirty five minutes late getting to us. I put in and received my 2500 free air miles for that issue. All in all, flights were fine, crews were great and on time for all sectors. I feel Alaska should move up to a 4 Star rating.",Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,First Class,ANC to SDF via ORD,Jul-15,4,5,4,4,4,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,7,Streb Lovell,12th July 2015,"One way, PDX-LAX. Everything was smooth sailing. Seats were comfortable, staff were great, and the flight was on time. I also like the electrical outlets in the seats. The big disappointment was the food. Nothing substantial on this flight except cookies and a small bag of pretzels. They made such a big deal about their cookies. I would have preferred an option such as fruit or cheese and crackers. I don't really know what they are thinking with this. I would have given them a 10 if not for the snack issue.",,Solo Leisure,First Class,PDX to LAX,Jul-15,5,5,2,4,5,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Jezrel Sabaduquia,11th July 2015,"LAX-SEA on the 737-800. Flew on 4th of July and the atmosphere on-board was festive and friendly. Flight attendants interacted with the passengers. Purser was lovely. The crew was probably one of the best and most friendly I have flown with. They went above and beyond when I realized I had left my jacket at the lounge and made sure I got it back. Seats comfortable with plenty of space for the 2-hour flight. Food and beverage selection was extensive. Excellent snack of pasta with marinara sauce, beans, along with with a salad which was fresh. Overall, a wonderful flight. Good lounge, excellent service, great food and comfortable seats.",Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,First Class,LAX to SEA,Jul-15,5,5,5,,5,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,21st June 2015,"Just returned to the Greatland having flown what is now my favorite airline once again. Departed ANC at 5 am and arrived ontime in SEA. I was bumped up to First due to my Gold status which I appreciate. The service was fine, the plane clean and all in all nothing to complain about. The trip to Redmond was on Horizon, a Q-400. No problems with anything here. If there was one thing though it would be the seats on the Q do not adjust at all. I wish they would but understand why they don't. The return trip was great on both legs. The crew was very impressive with their customer service.",Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,First Class,ANC to RDM via SEA,Jun-15,4,5,4,4,5,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,18th May 2015,Returned recently from a trip to SEA from ANC and SDF (on Am Eagle) to ORD then onto ANC. All flights were well run affairs with fine crews and great service. I flew First and when I get upgraded I always enjoy the experience. I am however more than pleased when I do not move up as the rest of the plane service crew does a fine job. I have yet to be unhappy with this airline since I have returned to using it on all my flights out and back to the Greatland. I have about six more flights scheduled in the next half year and I plan to fly them every time. Please keep it up!,,,First Class,,,5,5,4,5,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,W Campbell,16th May 2015,"Flight 893 9 May. I don't fly Alaska at all as my loyalties are with another airline at present because of frequent flier status. I flew last Saturday night at 9.45pm from Seattle to Oakland. What a difference in customer service. From the very start in the airport - their employees seemed gracious. The agents at the departure gate seemed relaxed and most affable as I watched them before our boarding call. My mainline carrier I usually fly - the employees always seem ""put out"" when they are interrupted from their computers. Inflight was pleasant. Flight attendants who seemed happy. If Alaska Airlines flew where I needed to go - they would have won me over.",,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,1,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,H Duncan,11th May 2015,Flight AS838 on 6 May. Flew Alaska from Honolulu to Oakland on 6 May. I was not expecting much for the cost of the first class ticket and was pleasantly surprised. Aircraft was not old (737-800) seat was spacious enough for a 5 hour day time flight. Meal was good and a nice linen service. Even the wine served was quite good and topped up regularly if you wished without having to ask. Crew were friendly and efficient. Even check in was quick and efficient. Overall a good experience and I think worth the extra for first class for this length flight. I rate it as highly as some domestic Australian business class flights I've had so it was quite good.,,,First Class,,,4,4,4,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,Terk El,27th April 2015,Upgraded to first class for our flight from SEA to DFW. Had seen Tom Douglas in the news lately talking his about the new menu he created for all Alaska flights. Our breakfast going down and dinner coming back was awful looking awful smelling and awful tasting. Many in 1st class that had the dinner on the return did not eat it. Even FA said she was embarrassed to be serving this meal. The spinach had a nasty smell to it.,,,First Class,,,4,4,1,3,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,David Hibbert,27th April 2015,Flew with family SJC-Honolulu then returned to SJC via Seattle. Economy Class. All planes were 737's of some variety. The seats were comfortable with adjustable headrests but legroom was terrible. I'm short so this was only a problem when I (or someone else) wanted to use the restroom as the person on the aisle seat had no choice but to get out of his seat to accommodate us. The cheese platter is an excellent meal available on all flights. Availability of hot meals was inconsistent and confusing (available one direction but not the other on flights before 9 am or after etc.). Flight attendants were friendly and attentive. However on our trip from HNL-SEA they disappeared 3 hours into the 5.5 hour flight and we were getting thirsty. Had to go ask for water. Hint: Alaska boards very early (45 min) and will depart early if they can. We once showed up 20 minutes before our departure time with boarding passes I had printed the night before and the plane had left already! They said they had paged us but we couldn't hear anything in that particular airport. Fortunately they had seats available on the next flight 2 hours later and got us on that for no charge.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,5,4,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,,L Green,10th April 2015,Flew First LA to Pueto Vallarta and had several issues. Firstly leg room was the poorest I'd experienced in first class ever. Secondly the cabin was far too cold and no rugs are supplied. Thirdly several passengers were allowed to remain in a reclined seat position for landing a safety issue. Lunch offered no choice - the chicken wedge salad was inedible. Luggage took well over the 20 minutes to arrive on the carousel. I could go on but let's just say I won't be flying with them again.,,,First Class,,,1,1,1,,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,10,Pomeranze Peter,4th March 2015,Kona - Oakland First class. What an improvement. Leaving United in the dust Alaska offers good food good service and decent leg room on this sector. Individual meals instead of all at one time distinguish this excellent offering from United using the same aircraft and only one hard working flight attendant. Finally a major carrier steps up and offers good service to and from Hawaii.,,,First Class,,,4,5,5,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,P Pomeranze,4th March 2015,Great service Seattle to Kona. Major upgrade in meal entertainment and attitude since last years trip. Keep it up Alaska you won me over.,,,First Class,,,4,5,4,5,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,S Sasse,24th February 2015,"I recently flew first class from Cancun Mexico to Seattle Washington. Having tried many times to upgrade and not having any luck I was excited that I finally got the chance. My boyfriend and I each used 10000 points to splurge on the trip home. I would never have done so if I knew how poor the service would be. Our steward was beyond rude. He offered no service whatsoever was totally unhelpful with any questions and hung out in the front away from the passengers. We had to ask for more water let alone a drink and when we did his attitude was atrocious. I realize first class isn't what it used to be but had I known what this would have been like I would have saved my points and stayed in coach I've had much better service there! Very disappointing for my first time going ""first class"".",,,First Class,,,4,1,1,5,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,Eva Sharp,23rd January 2015,I had never flown Alaska before this past 2014-15 Christmas/New Year season. My fiancÃ© had relocated for work to Portland OR from Massachusetts. We had two cats to move and decided it would be best for them to fly with me in the cabin for the holiday. The operator who booked the flights with my fiancÃ© was so helpful and made sure we had all the information we needed to get the cats ready. When I got to Logan Airport in Boston I was allowed to board early with the cat carriers. When one of my cats started getting antsy in her carrier and I had the carrier in my lap the stewardesses asked if the kitties needed anything. There was no fuss or problems traveling with the cats. Check in was smooth and easy on both going and coming. The Alaska Airlines staff is genuinely friendly and pleasant which is such a change from the canned fake concern most airlines staff seem to have. The mileage club is so easy to use and keep track of miles. It is nice to see that customer service is still a virtue in some companies.,,,Business Class,,,3,5,3,5,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Valerie Hart,21st January 2015,"Yesterday January 19 2015 I flew Flight 16 from Seattle back to Orlando. It had been a round-about 48 hour visit to an ill relative and I was exhausted from having to rise in the wee hours AM to board coming and going on the only non-stop flight. It has been many years since I have seen flight attendants so ""up-beat"" and kind with a sense of humor in the face of a fully packed jumbo jet. And too many years since I have seen well-groomed stewardesses actively caring for each passenger. Accolades to Alaska Airlines for returning to a more gracious time during these chaotic ones.",,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,Michael Bohlinger,14th January 2015,Travelled from Philadelphia to Maui via Seattle. Flew first class. After take off flight attendant stated that there were only 16 first class meals on board for the 16 first class seats. There were two choices of menu 8 each. She started taking orders at the front of the first class section and I was setting in the back when she got to me there were no choices left take the remaining selection or nothing. So I end up with nothing. She came back and offered me a cheese platter with 7 grapes and two so so cheeses and some crackers. Seats were standard first class seats which did not come close to lay flat. Hand held entertainment device did not work. Poor excuse for a first class flight.,,,First Class,,,2,2,1,3,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,11th January 2015,Returned early this morning from my flight Redmond to Seattle to Anchorage on Alaska in First. (upgraded). This flight was fine once we got into the air. Our plane had an issue or two which prevented an on time takeoff. We were about 70 minutes delayed but the crew did a fine job keeping everyone informed and did their usual fine job for the passengers. Paul was our employee in first and did an outstanding job great humor and fantastic work ethic. Even though we were late getting home to the Greatland nobody on board (from what I saw) griped about it. We were just glad to be back home.,,,First Class,,,,5,5,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Brian Parker,5th January 2015,Flew LAX-SEA-BLI on B737-900. Took the offer of a first class upgrade for $50. Friendly attentive crew and a meal was served. I always find Alaska good value for the money. The only drawback is the constant PA's telling you how to do everything from how to stow your bag in the overhead to not using the call bell unless it's a medical emergency. All in all though a safe comfortable and reasonably priced service.,,,First Class,,,4,4,3,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,7,Mark Wang,5th January 2015,"SEA to IAH return. First time flying on Alaska. Both legs were on time. Service was friendly. I appreciate the communication from the pilot or first officer with respect to turbulence and what's happening with the flight. Leg room was decent for economy class. Not a big fan of their food and beverage selections. Being a bit of a nervous flyer I generally tend to ask for 3 glasses of red wine when drink service is offered so I can slip slowly and make them last for a 4 hour flight and mellow out. One Flight Attendant took exception to me ordering 3 glasses (apparently fearing I was going to become intoxicated on the flight). In addition the wine service is poured from a bottle into a plastic cafeteria cup. Other airlines simply give you a little bottle which you pour yourself (which I much prefer). So this aspect was about the only thing that I give a thumbs down to. Another thing I like about some other airlines you have your own IFE system display. For me it's a matter of simply selecting ""My Flight"" as I like to see the progress of the flight. Not possible with Alaska.",,,Economy Class,,,4,3,2,2,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Brian Parker,5th January 2015,Flew BLI-SEA-SNA. Bellingham to Seattle on Horizon Q400. No service offered on this sector. Comfortable flight. Only 45 minute connection time in Seattle however made it to the next gate with ease. Boarded the B737-700 from the tarmac in the cold pouring Seattle rain instead of via an airbridge. Crew were efficient but no smiles or interactions with the passengers. Legroom excellent for economy and seat very comfortable. Really convenient being able to fly into John Wayne airport. I fly with Alaska fairly often and always find their service comfortable reliable and good value for the money.,,,Economy Class,,,5,3,3,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Ann Damian,29th December 2014,Left Santa Ana late because plane arrived late. Had connection in Portland and we only had now 5 minutes to get from gate C to lower level gate A. Dozen or so people running to their gates. Luckily for us there were several flyers going to Eugene so the flight was held and even waited for luggage. Thank you Alaska Airlines for making the end of our vacation a happy ending.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,6,H Dennis,22nd December 2014,SEA-IAH first class 739 equipment. Boarding was fine and efficient. Left about ten minutes late due to catering not being available until last minute. Hit cruise 19 minutes into flight but it was fully an hour before FA served drinks. Nothing unusual going on so this was inexplicable. Service was friendly but very slow.,,,First Class,,,4,3,3,4,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Brian Lally,10th December 2014,Recently traveled for the first time on an Alaska Airlines flight from San Diego-Boston. It was the best domestic flight I have experienced. The 4 cabin crew members were excellent and very customer engaged with passengers needs. The flight wasn't full and they came to me and asked if I wanted a row of seats to myself to relax for the duration of the flight. The service was great 3 rounds of snack and beverage service for the 5-hour flight. The aircraft was a Boeing 737-800 and the legroom was great. A job well done. I look forward to flying onboard in the near future. The only downfall to Alaska Airlines is they charge $10.00 for a video recorder to watch the movies. There should be no charge for that as it should be complimentary since snacks sandwiches and alcohol are charged to the customer.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,3,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,3,R Cleary,10th December 2014,12/1/14 ORD-SEA Flt 29. Arrived at the airport about 1.5 hours early. Only 1 agent at the counter. Waited about 15 mins before another agent appeared to assist. Once there it went smoothly and quickly. Boarding was efficient and able to be seated quickly. We were issued their digiplayers. Fair selection of movies to view but really no place to put the player when the meal arrived. A bit cumbersome. Meal offered was one choice only. It was tasty but portions have certainly been scaled back. Flight attendant disappeared after the meal service. Arrived on time. However I remember Alaska having a far superior service to that of its rivals but this flight did not prove that at all.,,,First Class,,,3,1,3,3,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,3,R Cleary,10th December 2014,12/4/14 SEA to ORD Flt 22. When checking in one has to perform a self bag tag and then take the luggage to the check in desk. There were 2 of us - we had 1 bag to check. It was over by 4lbs but since you are allowed two pieces of luggage per person we were well with in the weight limit. Too bad cost $75. Flight departed on time. Staff were friendly service was standard. Same meal offered on both segments but yet again nothing remarkable that would make me select this carrier over the competition. Once meal was served and one refresher of drinks the FA disappeared. I was disappointed with the overall service. It is not what I was accustomed to. A digiplayer for the entertainment was handed out but it is cumbersome to have on your tray table when the meal is served.,,,First Class,,,3,2,3,3,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,8,S Koenig,4th December 2014,SEA-LAX. Standard seating food etc for a 2.5 hour flight. As first class has an advantage over others in that you get access to their airline club even if you are flying just domestic and not connecting to an international flight (and aren't a club member). Alaska has both refundable and non-refundable first class fares. Non-refundable is about 1/2 the cost of the refundable but is not available on all routes (e.g. we were going to fly to BUR but only fc fare was refundable so we chose to fly to LAX instead).,,,First Class,,,4,4,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,L Haubert,1st December 2014,Traveled first class San Diego to Boston on 11/20/14. Plane left on time clean friendly flight attendants good breakfast and service and champagne. No complaints and felt it worth the money.,,,First Class,,,4,4,4,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,7,D Parker,11th November 2014,Flew one of the Alaska/Horizon regional routes PDX-MFR night flight. The flight was originally at 9.05-ish but was delayed to 9.55. Got info 3 hours ahead of time and we still boarded late because traffic on the taxiway. Once aboard seats were fairly comfy flight attendants were friendly easily accommodated my sister's severe nut allergy made sure no nut-containing items were aboard the plane (standard airline safety procedure) and served two drinks for a flight less than an hour. Not bad Alaska.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,A Bastien,28th October 2014,10-12-14 early flight SMF to SEA. Seats were thin but comfortable legroom seemed a bit more generous than the space I'm used to on other carriers seats had power outlets. I flew Alaska as part of a Delta flight from SMF- SEA-DTW-TVC the ticket purchased with my spouse's frequent flyer miles. I would choose to fly Alaska again over another airline even if the ticket price was higher. The aircraft didn't have entertainment. The food selection looked decent although I didn't buy any.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,1,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,M Bockstruck,28th October 2014,Flew Alaska MCI to SEA return in First. Both legs were pleasant but the service on the outbound leg got off to a slow start with no pre-take off beverage offered. However once we were in the air the flight attendant was very quick to begin beverage service. Seats were comfortable but the pitch was a little tight I wish Alaska would invest in some bigger planes for their longer cross country flights in order to have a larger First Class cabin. Food was very good served plated and fresh. Check In both in Kansas City and Seattle was extremely easy and the Board Room in Seattle was pleasant. For a full fare ticket it wasn't an overall bad experience but felt that I overpaid slightly for what I got. Will fly Alaska First again in December and am looking forward to gaining elite status with them. Their mileage earning partnerships cannot be beat and I love that I can fly Delta American British Airways and Emirates as needed and still earn miles.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Schrier Michael,12th October 2014,Flew from SFO to ANC to SFO with stopover in SEA on 5th and 13th September 2014. These were routine flights. There were no delays in fact each leg was a few minutes ahead of schedule and baggage came out in the first few minutes. The Champagne and Beer was cold the food was really just snacks as we travelled in between normal mealtimes. This was good value as we were allowed 2 pieces of luggage each. I would definitely recommend this airline.,,,First Class,,,4,5,4,3,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,1st October 2014,My wife and I travelled to SEA and return to ANC recently on Alaska. No issues at all problem wise. Both flights were fine crews were great lanes clean on time arrivals etc. I tried to upgrade to First as I am a MVP Gold member but alas no luck. Maybe next time. I told my spouse it is a nice experience and she was hoping to see it firsthand. Anyhow keep up the good work and thanks Alaska.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,K Homestead,1st October 2014,Took Alaska to Cabo on Sept 15th Alaska stated flight is still going. Get to San Diego Cabo flight still going. 30 minutes later our flight is cancelled. Alaska says no seats open back to Seattle tough luck. Find out the Cabo airport was shut down the day before and Alaska flew us to San Diego knowing this.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,,E Jones,14th September 2014,I had a flight scheduled from ATL-SEA and the day of it was cancelled. So just four hours before my flight I was scrambling to get another flight that day.. Not only that but they didn't even send an alert that the flight was cancelled. My google alerts notified me about the cancellation. The customer service is non-existent and I will never book with them again. Book at your own risk!,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen Sweet,9th September 2014,Returned last week from a ANC-SEA-ATL and return in First. No complaints with the flights at all. As usual (for me) the service was outstanding the planes clean and the flight crews were very friendly. We were told we would be departing ATL about an hour late due to a crew rest issue. This would cause me to miss my connection to ANC in Seattle. I was rebooked quickly by the ATL folks. I caught my flight with minutes to spare in SEA but of course my bag did not show until the next flight. The Alaska employee at baggage claim was tired and a bit grumpy but I was given a coupon for 2500 miles and that was fine with me. Besides this issue all was great. Looking forward to our next flight to SEA this Thursday evening.,,,First Class,,,5,5,5,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Judith Mihaere,1st September 2014,We have just arrived back in New Zealand after our Alaskan cruise and would like to commend Alaska Airlines customer service desk for their excellent and sympathetic response to out late arrival due to tardy shuttle service resulting in our late arrival at LAX airport. We were very stressed as were to travel to Seattle the staff member advised that although our flight hadn't quite left it was indeed too late to get on but immediately advised that they had a flight every hour and could get us on the next flight. After all this there was no extra charges for this change we were so impressed with that.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,D Smith,1st September 2014,Alaska is our airline of choice. MCI-SEA-ANC flights generally good and on time. New Sky interior slimline Recaro seats (a bit uncomfortable). On landing at Anchorage the pilot apparently took a wrong taxiway or misjudged the turn as he braked to a halt (squeal on the brakes hard stop) then used reverse thrusters to turn the plane completely around. ANC-SEA-MCI late flight out of ANC substituted a smaller plane which put us in a non-recline seat. All in all we have been satisfied with Alaska and will continue to use them as these are somewhat minor issues and tend to be found on all airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,5,5,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Joseph Hammer,28th August 2014,I flew Alaska non-stop from Dallas to Portland first class. The crew were very friendly and attentive to everyone's needs. We had an hour delay after boarding the aircraft in Dallas but the crew kept everybody informed and kept serving drinks and a small snack for us. Very impressed with their first class service.,,,First Class,,,5,5,4,5,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,J Briolat,28th August 2014,"Recently flew on Alaska Airlines with my 2 longer legs (TUS to SEA and ANC to PDX) in First Class. On these flights (along with the other 2 segments) the flight and flight crew were fine. My complaint is with what defines ""First Class"" to Alaska Airlines. On TUS-SEA our meal consisted of a chicken sandwich and a chocolate mint! No inflight entertainment devices provided. On the ANC-PDX segment (which was 2.45 Alaska time to 7am PDX time). No wake-up breakfast which meant zero food provided at all. Flight attendant asked if we wanted anything as we were already in the process of pre-landing operations. And since an overnight flight no inflight entertainment. Guess I'm expecting too much for paying for a first class seat.",,,Economy Class,,,5,5,3,2,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,,K Plachta,28th August 2014,"Flying from Soldotna AK we were fogged in. In only takes a short while for fog to burn off but they delayed the flight twice and then canceled it. I had the option to either have a 12 hour layover in Anchorage or spend the night in Seattle's airport. After waiting 3 hours I was flown to Anchorage. I had 100lbs of frozen fish I worked hard catching. Alaska air refused to help in any way. No mailing my fish home no putting it in a freezer. They refused to put me in a hotel to sleep no options whatsoever. I called them and the woman told me ""We can't pick up the tab for every act of God"" and ""this happens all the time."" Once in Anchorage I tried to switch to the flight where I stay overnight in Seattle because someone I knew had a freezer and I could stay there. Customer service said 1 seat was left while asking her supervisor permission the seat was taken. I took the next flight 4 hours later only to find out the freezer was unavailable so late at night. So I was sent by customer service to get my fish from baggage (it was checked) then come back. I did and asked again to change to the plan to layover 12 hours in Anchorage. I went and waited in line again. I got my fish into the freezer in Anchorage for 28$ not bad but I shouldn't have to pay for that. 3 hours in Soldotna 12 hours in Anchorage a red-eye flight to Seattle then another 3 hour lay-over until my next flight home which is only a 2.5 hour drive. I was so exhausted. I can't believe this happens all the time and everyone lets them get away with this.",,,Economy Class,,,3,3,2,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,4,Amanda Miller,28th August 2014,My first flight from Vancouver to Seattle was great - the crew were fantastic. However my flight from Seattle to Salt Lake City was not very enjoyable. I found the crew to be lazy and rude. I tried to order a beverage on the plane and they had closed out early (1 hour early) and right after they had passed with the drink cart. I've flown before and unless there is turbulence then typically a plane will serve you until about 30 minutes before landing. One flight attendant was very rude. I usually love flying Alaska and was about to apply for my Alaska Air credit card but this was very disappointing. I think I may hold back on applying because of this particular experience.,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,2,3,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,10,A Forsythe,26th August 2014,This week on my trip to Seattle I flew Alaska Airlines when in the past I would normally fly United. Alaska Airlines far exceeded my expectations. If I could use them to fly everywhere I would. The flight attendants actually seemed happy and were very nice. The seats were extremely comfortable - much more comfortable than other flights that I've been on. The plane was clean. I will definitely fly with Alaska Airlines anytime I can.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,,Tom Eichenberg,18th August 2014,We flew from Maui to Seattle with a connection in Seattle to Washington D.C. First the plane leaving Maui was delayed for over 3 hours. Alaska Airlines took us off our connecting flight without telling us (Seattle to D.C.) and booked us on a much later flight. Thank goodness I checked before departing from Maui. I was told that they didn't think there would be enough time to make the connection. I asked for them to get me on another flight/airline where I wasn't waiting for my connection for five or more hours. They couldn't do this I was told. I demanded to be put back on the earlier connection and told them I would attempt to make the connection although I had less than 30 minutes to do so. I was told that my seats were already taken by someone else. I informed them that tickets had been given to me already for my seats and they had better get me back on that plane. After some time they did get me back onto the connecting flight from Seattle to D.C. The plane from Maui to Seattle took off several hours late and it did not have very good air conditioning. The plane was hot poor service and I was not impressed at all with Alaska Airlines. I will never fly with them again. The connecting flight from Seattle to D.C. was also very hot on the plane. Don't fly Alaska Airways. Go with another carrier such as United Delta or American Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,3,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,,Tymoshenko Yevgeniy,5th August 2014,Flight was supposed to depart at 1.30pm from Seattle to Long Beach but it didn't. For the first hour the flight was delayed because one of the aircraft crew was lateâ€ù Then we were told the flight was delayed for another 3 hours. I could not wait any longer. I requested to be put on another available flight to California. I was placed on flight # 464Y Seattle to Los Angeles with departure time at 7.25 pm. I wasted 6 hours of my time and I had to pay an extra fee to rent a car from LAX area and pay with higher rate. I arrived in a hotel at 11.30 pm. The trip to Long Beach took me 12 hours instead of 5 hours. I would be OK with this if the flight back to Seattle had not been canceled too. Flight 3477 from Long Beach to Seattle with departure time at 7.25 pm was canceled because of some engine problems. At 11.00 pm I was told that the aircraft would not be fixed any soon and all hotels around Long Beach and LAX were booked. I had to take a taxi to LAX and had to sleep on the bench in LAX airport so I could finally fly to Seattle on the 6am flight. It was the worst experience in flight and I am flying for business a lot.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,7,P Sawyers,2nd August 2014,Flew LAX to DCA. Delay leaving LAX due to air traffic congestion but was kept informed. The seats were pretty uncomfortable considering this was a 5+ hours flight. I was very glad that I purchased a 'comfort seat' alongside as I was coming off a 15 hour flight from Australia and had space to spread out. The cabin crew were lovely and most helpful. We had a strange delay in DCA as we arrived 2 hours late due to earlier delay and adverse weather around DC and the Alaska gate was taken by another Alaska plane and we ended up waiting around 30 minutes on the tarmac for space to be found. Would use them again but would definitely purchase the comfort seat for added space.,,,Economy Class,,,2,5,3,2,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Daun Frederickson,2nd August 2014,We traveled home from Las Vegas on Tuesday July 29. Our plane was 4.5 hours late and I cannot say enough how great the Alaska Airline staff were . They were very helpful apologetic and kept us informed the entire time on what the updates were on our flight and when we could expect to take off. We really appreciated the positive attitude and genuine care of their employees. It made the inconvenience of having to wait for our flight much easier and very helpful.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen G Sweet,2nd August 2014,Just returned from my trip south ANC-SEA-EUG and returned EUG-PDX-ANC. All flights were fine the crews were all professional clean aircraft on time and the food was quite decent. We had quite a few young children flying back to Alaska with their parents from 3 months of age up to five in my section. The flight attendants were very helpful and appeared to enjoy the interaction with the little ones. I flew the 400 model combi south for the first time. Not bad at all for a red eye flight. All in all a fine experience.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Kaldate Rajesh,29th July 2014,July 24th. Flew SLC-SFO in the morning and returned the same evening. Best short haul domestic experience this year. Boarding handled smoothly. Flight crew extremely polite and courteous. Cabin nice clean and the temp. Was well controlled. Both flights on perfect time. Will try to fly more with Alaska if possible.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,1,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Ramona Tyma,20th July 2014,Flew from Orlando on 5/29/14. Flying from Tampa to Seattle on 8/9/14 and returning on 8/31/14. Crew were attentive friendly and a pleasure to spend 5.5 hours with. Food was fresh warm and tasty. I am so happy they added round trip non-stop Tampa to Seattle. Absolutely perfect for me.,,,First Class,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,A Santiago,12th July 2014,PHX-SEA and back. The crew signed my Alaska Airlines history book they all chatted with me and seemed in good spirits. The flight was handled smoothly and the drinks and food was generous considering what we got was being offered free (sandwiches however cost 6 dollars on economy class).,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,7,Sukasem Tejatanalert,8th July 2014,Flew from Los Angeles to Anchorage on Alaska 149. The flight left and arrived in destination on time. The purchase food quality and quantity were OK. The drinks provided during the flight are more than adequate. The service was nice.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,,S Morse,6th July 2014,Plane delayed due to mechanical trouble. So they re-routed another flight and changed the direction of the flight and the stops although still ending up in Seattle where we were headed. So instead of leaving around 11am we left more like at 4pm. At our first stop in Wrangel some people got on. Then some more. Then a few more. After a while the crew started counting passengers. Then did it again. And again. Then they started asking names as well as counting. Then did that again. And again. And again. As far as I could tell they never found any trouble and never made anyone leave the plane. Then they said we were overweight and had to unload some fuel. After that they started counting and naming again. When I asked if they be serving dinner since it was now after 4 and we wouldn't get to Seattle until after at least 9 pm they said they had 4 wraps on board to sell. The CSA then came on the plane and yelled at me for delaying the plane! For asking if we'd get fed! More than an hour after that harangue we left. We arrived in Seattle around 1 am hungry.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen Sweet,23rd June 2014,ANC to SLC return in First both directions. I have no complaints whatsoever. The food was fine the service was excellent on-time both directions and the plane was clean. Their SLC growth (# of flights to and from there) has not affected their great customer service negatively as far as I could tell. One thing which was different on the return flight though was that the flight attendant came around prior to our landing and thanked each customer for flying with Alaska and I felt she meant it. It was a small but very classy thing to do as I have never seen this before. It is the small but kind gestures that help make a difference when I fly. Keep it up Alaska!,,,First Class,,,5,5,5,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,P Miller,9th June 2014,PSP-PDX-LAX. Two flights with Alaska both of which were on time departures and arrivals. Friendly cabin crew adequate legroom. All in all a good experience.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,John Logan,4th June 2014,In May I flew with the airline three times: San Francisco to Seattle at the start of my visit then a return flight at the end. In between I flew from Palm Springs to Seattle with the airline. All were good and timely. My main comments are words of praise for the check-in team at Seattle at the start of my return flight when they worked long and diligently to ensure my luggage in the hold was correctly tagged directly back to my home airport in Perth Australia for that 21-hour flight via Hong Kong.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,B Bachman,1st June 2014,I flew from Seattle to Anchorage on a 737-800 with the new slimline Recaro seats. Each seat had a power outlet with a USB port and the seats were very comfy with an adjustable head rest and more legroom compared to the old seats. I noticed that there was no longer a barrier between first class and coach but maybe they will install it later. I had 30 minutes of free Wi-Fi thanks to a partnership with Allstate. I tested the speed at 2 Mb/sec download and 0.25 Mb/sec upload. I rented an entertainment player for $8 and had time to watch a movie along with a few other clips. The devices are a little slow and touchy but are still functional. Soon Alaska Airlines will offer entertainment on your own iPads laptops etc. I purchased the chicken dinner for $6 which consisted of boneless chicken breast mashed potatoes and green beans and actually tasted very good. The drink cart went around 2 times during the 3 hour flight and the second time I had delicious orange Tazo tea. Overall a great experience with great service all around!,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen Sweet,29th May 2014,Just back from my 3 week tour of the Lower 48 using Alaska from ANC-SEA-ATL return in First. All aspects of my various flights went smoothly. Very enjoyable experience. Flight crews were attentive clean aircraft arrival times early on most of the flights and the food was quite good as well. No complaints at all. Heading south again in two weeks to SCL. Looking forward to the Alaskan Experience once again.,,,First Class,,,5,5,4,5,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Jim Fitzgerald,25th May 2014,My Wife and I have used various Airlines in USA fairly extensively over the years. First time on Alaskan and can only highly recommend them. Service from check in Kerbside to arrival destination was perfect and should ever we visit USA again will use them if opportunity exists.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen Sweet,7th May 2014,Just back from a trip from ANC to Portland then SMF and return. We departed about 40 minutes late from ANC due to a switch issue but made up for it enroute. We had a medical emergency also but the passenger was given oxygen and was well cared for by the crew. Horizon provided the flight south to Sacramento and that was fine in all regards. The trip back was nearly perfect. My only issue is the waiting room in Portland it is a zoo! Otherwise - great!,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Jason Burnie,1st May 2014,Flew SEA to SAN in April. Absolutely flawless. Check in was simple and hassle free. Once onboard all cabin crew were so pleasant. Repeated drinks service throughout the flight. One passenger taken ill the crew were reaching out for doctors onboard and they also stood by. Plenty of legroom in economy. Aircraft 737-800 seemed brand new. Interior was clean and fresh. Baggage was on the belt in no time despite it was a short walk from the gate to the belt. Absolutely on top of my choice among American carriers.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Frank Hilton,23rd April 2014,I flew Palm Springs to Portland. We departed Palm Springs 5.5 hours late due to a wind/dust storm. The crew were fantastic. We were on and off the plane a couple of times. The passengers never got cranky because of the high degree of professionalism and good vibes from the crew. I have never had a bad flight on Alaska and it is always my first choice.,,,First Class,,,5,5,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,Stephen G Sweet,22nd April 2014,"Returned last week from my annual trip to Reno from ANC. The flight out was fine good service clean plane and landed a few minutes early in SEA. The flight to RNO was great on Horizon good crew with great service. The only complaint I have are the gates at Portland for the ""Seattle Shuttle"" are pretty crammed together and I accidentally tried to board the wrong flight. The gate agent pointed this out to me and was a bit short attitude wise. I asked about how many flights are leaving at 3.30? She said ""one at that time and the one you are on starts to board at that time and leaves at 4! I was not the only person who had this issue but no problem after that. I got to SEA and the flight home to ANC was fine. I will be flying them again this next Monday going to SMF. I expect my flights will be fine.",,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Karl Moosbrugger,21st April 2014,SEA-KOA my first ever flight with Alaska. Check-in at SEA was quick and efficient. Onboard I was positively surprised by the seat pitch; much more leg room than on most other airlines (and I am quite tall). Flight itself was partly bumpy due to weather but the crew cheered everyone up with free Mai Tais shortly before reaching Hawaii. Never had that with any other airline. Flight was on time the food for purchase was OK. Overall a very good experience. Will certainly use them again.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,4,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Trevor Kowbel,13th April 2014,My first experience with Alaska Airlines. I didn't expect the level of service from the stewards onboard. My two young sons myself and my wife traveled from Edmonton to Seattle and then to Honolulu. The stewards dealing with objectionable passengers children running up and down the aisle were professional and polite. I was able to extend my legs into the aisle without being harassed to remove them. On return bad weather delayed our connection.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,5,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,7,G Gifari,13th April 2014,Flew on Flight 447 from LAX to SEA. Codeshare with Qantas. Plane was modern but interior looked dreadfully tiresome. For a low cost carrier their seat pitch was amazing. Cabin crew friendly and engaging with passengers. Besides the typical buy-on-board they give you something for your metabolism and non-alcoholic beverages are complementary. I ordered one of their buy-on-board but the crew forgot to serve it to me even though they have charged my card and all. Thus they ran out on that option after serving it to all the other passengers. Cabin crew's apologies were sincere and they did their best to make it up for me.,,,Economy Class,,,5,3,3,,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,,Laura Nathanson,6th April 2014,Flew first class from JFK to San Diego flight 769 on April 1. And it did feel like an April Fool return to 1955. No pocket with safety info and sick bag no blankets or pillows provided stewardesses never once went through to collect trash. Food was allergy-unfriendly with bowl of mixed nuts for appetizer and a nut topped parfait for dessert. Worst of all though was the feeling of no safety consciousness. The two stewardesses functioned as - hostesses. Three young men each kept coming up repeatedly to ask a question use the bathroom get a soft drink. The boys would stay in the food prep area for several minutes chatting and then linger in the first class cabin to perform stretching exercises. On all other airlines that I've been on this kind of thing is just unheard of. I would not fly this airline again.,,,First Class,,,5,1,1,,,,no
Alaska Airlines,5,M Gephart,28th March 2014,Rebooked onto Alaska due to cancellation of my original flight on UA from SEA to LAX. The aircraft was pretty worn (737-400) and the IFE non-existent. The legroom was frightening. Once the pax in front of me reclined my knees were against his seat for the duration. Cabin crew were good and service was perfunctory. However I could've done without the 5 minute announcement ploy for their credit card and corresponding benefits (not to mention the FA walking down the aisle with applications). Got me from point to point but I have to say I wasn't really that impressed.,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,1,,,no
Alaska Airlines,,M Tighe,3rd March 2014,Had our reservations with other connecting flights and rental cars for 3 days on Oahu and 7 days on Maui this coming June. We were very excited! Then we checked our itineraries and Alaska Airlines cancelled our return flight #883. Alaska re-booked our Honolulu departure 12 hours earlier but we would not get back from Maui to catch it until 8 hours later. They gave us 2 choices: the earlier flight or full refund. Very nice Alaska especially considering the inter island flight is non-cancellable nor are the rental cars etc. Since we made non- cancellable tickets and obtained a confirmation from Alaska I will not ever trust them again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,Bastien Antoine,17th February 2014,February 1 2014. Flight 381 from SEA (Seattle) to SMF (Sacramento). I paid the extra $50 for a first class upgrade. The upgrade was worth the $50.00 although leg room wasn't what I would have expected (I was in 1D behind the bulkhead). The food and complimentary wine were good the service competent. I would recommend Alaska based on my first class travel experience.,,,First Class,,,4,5,4,1,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,T Osterman,17th February 2014,I am an Alaska Gold 75K and due to all the flight time I am seeing an increasing amount of maintenance holds delays and flight impact due to demand maintenance. On a flight from SEA to PSP that was on gate hold for 30 minutes due to a cockpit printer malfunction. The pilots PA circuit also malfunctioned with very loud audio noise in the background that made his communication to the cabin almost inaudible. Given the monthly frequency of gate hold maintenance events I am seeing as a passenger I am concerned about the competency funding and oversight of their maintenance program.,,,First Class,,,2,3,2,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,M Marshall,20th January 2014,Seattle-Kodiak-Seattle. Very nice trip. Airline personnel were friendly and efficient. Only minor complaint is that the seats hardly tip back.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Mauricio Perez,29th December 2013,I flew from San Jose California to Seattle. The service was ok the plane was on-time. Boarding was delayed 2 mins but we arrived in Seattle 15 minutes before schedule. Two weeks later I flew from Seattle to Los Angeles - it was a connecting flight perfect again. The service of the crew members were good the flight was on-time again and no problems with the baggage. It went directly to my final destination (Guadalajara Mexico). Both aircraft's were Boeing 737-900 they were very clean and comfortable the legroom was ok. If I can I will fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,3,,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Garone Remo,20th December 2013,June 2013. One flight from LAX to SEA and another a few days later from ANC to LAX. Friendly and professional crew (on board and at the airport) modern aircraft (B737-800 and B737-900/ER) departure and arrival on time luggage recovered 5 minutes after arrival. I would say only one thing: Next time I will fly with Alaska Airlines again! An excellent low cost company.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,2,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,S Sparks,19th December 2013,"I have been flying Alaska for many years. For the last several years I have been flying first class only and have been very satisfied with the food the service and the extra space. This last trip though made me wonder if I should continue to pay the substantial difference in price to be in first class. It was the space in the new plane. The space between me and the seat in front is closer. I had to struggle to get my bag under the seat in front of me when the passenger in front of me had his seat back. I'm 5'5' and 125 lbs. Also there used to be three big spaces under the 1st class seats for two people. Now there are two with one other smaller space big enough to fit a purse maybe. I don't like to use the overhead but I can change. There still seemed to be plenty of space between me and the passenger next to me. I like the three moveable light fixtures and the ability to direct air flow on the ceiling better. The food is still good and the service good. Although staff service on the majority of my flights has been ""excellent"" I can only honestly rate this last trip as ""fair."" I am grateful to her though for this information. I heard her tell the two passengers in front of me that staff call the new planes ""slaveships"" because there are 44 more seats (!) but no more staff (still 4) to serve passengers. She said something to the effect of ""I feel sorry for the people in back. They get served so late or barely at all."" I'm thinking that on my next trip coming up shortly I will go coach one way just to see if I can still justify paying the difference in price. But thanks to the overheard words of the staff attendant I will sit in the middle or closer to the front in coach so that I will get better service and won't have to wait forever. I will also plan to bring on board some food and a beverage. Overall I really like Alaska although I haven't flown any others for a long time. Maybe I will venture onto another airline just to compare. I never have trouble checking in no lost luggage airport gate staff friendly and professional. There are a lot of things I like about Alaska.",,,First Class,,,4,3,5,,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Leah Gomez,16th December 2013,My time on Alaska airlines was ok. I was flying from Sacramento California to Seattle Washington. The flight attendants were nice and cheerful. The flight left on time and the flight attendants gave us a bag of beef jerky for the inflight meals. We ended up landing about 10 minutes early and the only thing I recommend is that they add inflight entertainment otherwise I recommend that you fly with Alaska.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,3,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Dale Becker,9th December 2013,I often fly on Alaska/Horizon flights between Montana and Seattle or Portland. My overall experiences have been very good. Flights even in winter have been on time and counter and plane staff have always been excellent. Value is very good compared with the few other carriers (Delta and United) that we have to choose from here in Montana. Seats on Alaska planes could be more comfortable as they are small and fairly stiff and uncomfortable but most flights are short so it is not a big issue for me. You can't carry on larger bags on the smaller planes but their a la cart process still allows me not to have to check in my carry on and pick it up after landing. Overall my satisfaction with Alaska is very good.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,2,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,2,R Leahy,3rd December 2013,Absolutely awful service. I missed a flight to Honolulu for business because my connecting flight (also an Alaska Airlines flight) was 25 minutes late arriving. I got to the departure gate for Honolulu in time to see the plane sit there for a few minutes before pushing back if only they have held the plane 5-10min so me and the half dozen other connecting passengers could make the flight. Worse yet they offered no hotel or even club accommodations even thought this was the last flight out and it was entirely the airline's fault that we didn't make the connectionâ€”service reps said it wasn't their problem since they were 'only' 20min late and blamed my booking. I'll never fly Alaska Airlines again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,3,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,10,T Shant,2nd December 2013,LAX-YVR-LAX. On the flight to YVR we were greeted with great service at the gate. The aircraft was nice and clean and had a lot of legroom on the B737-400. Even though we were delayed a bit we still had a good flight. The service was great. We had complimentary drinks and the food a cheese plate was delicious and was worth the $7 dollar price. On the flight out to LAX we were delayed from 6am to 11.45am due to maintenance issues. Because of this they rebooked all of the people traveling to Mexico and the first class passengers. They also gave $40 breakfast vouchers. This proves excellent service. Also the first officer took us on a tour of the cockpit which was really nice. Since so many people left this flight onto a flight to Mexico the flight was almost empty. The seats were very comfortable on the Boeing 737-400 and the food and service were great as well especially because they were handing out every order for free due to the delay. Because of this Alaska Airlines is a great airline and I definitely recommend.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,J Dickinson,27th November 2013,Round trip Seattle to Fort Lauderdale family of 4 for a cruise Nov 8 return 16th. Great experience considering we go in with low expectations our own food iPads etc. I was watching the on-time performance for a few weeks prior to departure and it seems this flight leaves the gate early more often than being on-time and our experience was no different - we pushed off 10-15 mins early both coming and going. Crew were experienced polite and helpful. 3 drink cart visits for the 6 hour flight with in-between bottled water. Gate checked our carry-ons for free. All good.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,David Iles,4th November 2013,Long Beach - Seattle Friday 25 Oct. An excellent experience with Alaska check in at Long Beach was easy and the flight boarded on time for an on time departure. The cabin crew were excellent throughout the flight.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,David Iles,4th November 2013,Seattle - Redmond - Seattle 26 Oct. This year chose to fly rather than drive and good decision. Easy check in at Seattle plane on time and boarding very efficient. Whilst short fly cabin crew were excellent and arriving at Redmond was a delight only plane on ramp and backs in 6/7 mins. Return flight equally as good with on time departure and great team on board. Would certainly choose Alaska again based upon my recent experiences.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Caroline Scandura,25th October 2013,Very pleasant flight that I expect to make frequently visiting daughter in Bend Oregon. Friendly and helpful staff: Went back to plane to recover my jacket. But I have 2 complaints: Elderly neighbor got a $65 ticket when he pulled over in the loading zone to answer my call on his cell (that I was late) and Alaska's Seattle wait room sure looked shabby. Otherwise a very good experience.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Stephen Sweet,25th October 2013,Recently returned from ANC-ATL-ANC in first class. I was quite pleased overall with not only the service attitudes of the cabin crew but also the layout of the B-900. The flights were all on time and the food was actually quite good. The crew from ANC to SEA (red-eye) was great with a flair for humor. I do not always travel upfront unfortunately but decided to give it a go wish I could do it every flight. No complaints here. I will continue to use Alaska.,,,First Class,,,4,5,4,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,J Simister,25th October 2013,I have flown several times with Alaskan Airlines over the past few years. I am Canadian and live 2.5 hrs from Spokane Washington. I have found all employees to be polite and helpful over the phone at check-in or while flying. I did have a flight delay in January but all passengers were kept informed of what was going on. I much prefer Alaskan Air over Air Canada. I will be flying with Alaskan again on Nov 6/13 to Hawaii.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,D Bergevin,23rd October 2013,Round trip Seattle to Houston. Everything as expected on time friendly crew arrived back in Seattle 30 minutes early. Have flown Alaska at least once a year for the past 10 years have never had a late flight or lost luggage. Companion fare is a great deal $99.00 + tax anywhere they fly. If you don't like the seats in back quit whining and pony up the money to sit up front.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,D Sirias,20th October 2013,My main issue is the check in. Flight from SMF to PDX was on the small propeller jet. Those do not have overhead room for normal overhead luggage. But they don't tell you. Hence you are forced to tag bags at the gate and place on cart for checking just like regular checked bags. What if you had something temperature sensitive. It's stupid not to inform customers that the plane does not have normal overhead storage. On the return flight it took half hour to check bags because the airline was understaffed line oppressively long. If I fly Alaska again I will bring a backpack only that's sure to fit in the tiny overhead compartment. Tell us if we get normal overhead. That's all I ask.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,,,,no
Alaska Airlines,10,S Conlon,13th October 2013,I've flown close to 50000 miles this year - all on Alaska Airlines. I've been flying Alaska for 15 plus years. Most of my travel is up and down the west coast with a NY Boston Orlando Chicago trip thrown in on occasion. Overall Alaska has done an amazing job all around. I've had one bag go missing in the last 15 years. It showed up at my door before 8 am the next morning. The food choices are excellent in coach and the few times I've been in First Class it's been wonderful. Their beverage choices are extensive and you can purchase an entertainment system on flights over 2 hours. Alaska's flight attendants are great - very friendly and accommodating and most of them have a great sense of humor! The few times I've had to fly other airlines I've discovered there is no comparison.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,C Obryant,10th October 2013,I had not flown with Alaska Airlines for a number of years but had a good experience previously. I had a 6 leg trip this past week from LAX to ANC to FAI to Cordova to JNU and to SIT then finally to SEA. Every trip was on time or ahead of schedule. FA were attentive and polite. F&B service was good. I had the food purchase options on 2 flights and was very pleased. Not overly priced and was fresh with good flavor. Only downside was in LAX boarding was chaotic. Gate agent shows up 5 minutes before boarding so many confused passengers. On all flights I noticed the upholstery on the seats were quite worn. A little surprised when most flight were on 737-700 or 800 series aircraft. Anyway all in all a successful trip with Alaska Airlines. Flights on time and my baggage made every flight. I would certainly endorse Alaska Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,5,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,Stephen G Sweet,1st October 2013,Recently flew Alaska from Anchorage to SEA and then down to Redmond OR to take our daughter to college. The trip down was fine in all respects good service new 737-900 and on time. The trip to Redmond was on Horizon and they did fine as well. The return trip was Redmond to Portland then up to Anchorage again no problems. We departed a bit late from Portland due to a windshield wiper problem but due to the upper level winds due to the massive rainstorm in Portland we were just a few minutes late arriving in ANC. All in all good job all the way around by all crews and staff. I will fly them shortly to ATL and we will see how they do in First.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,P Pomeranze,24th September 2013,I was not looking forward to 6 hours in a 737 from Seattle to Kona in first. In actuality the trip was not bad at all. Decent leg room and meal service were all complemented by a hard working and friendly flight attendant who serviced 20 people on her own. Digi player was decently loaded for entertainment. By today's lowered standards this flight was quite nice.,,,First Class,,,4,5,4,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Krishnan Vaitheeswaran,15th September 2013,SEA-ANC-SEA KTN-JNU JNU-ANC-HNL in B737s during the month of August. Managed to get a Row 6 seat in each of them which led to being offered priority boarding. Every flight was either on time or ahead of schedule. Excellent in-flight service. This is an exceptional American carrier in the north-west of the country. Being slugged twice for baggage despite travelling on a single itinerary was the sole gripe.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,Simon Adlam,5th September 2013,LAX-PDX. Very good early morning flight to PDX. Cabin a little tired and cramped but service was some of the best. The breakfast was actually really good - eggs benedict and bloody mary's. First time flying them and would again. They need to upgrade there interior product though as looks worn.,,,First Class,,,3,5,5,2,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,D Silvey,28th August 2013,Flights Bellingham to Honolulu in Coach. Seats are tight but that's the sign of the times. Service was sparse. You are nickeled and dimed on everything now. Gone are the days of Wardair. Guess that's why they aren't in business. Miss the days when air flight was fun. Having said that out flights we good and we didn't really expect much more for the price we paid. Would take this trip with Alaska Air again.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,3,3,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,B Bachman,26th August 2013,Upgraded to First Class from JNU to ANC for $50 (1.5 hour flight). This was my 1st First Class experience and I was not impressed. Water was offered before take off. The plane was a slightly aged 737-400. At first the seats seem okay but they hardly recline and there is no adjustable headrests. This makes the seats unsuitable for sleeping in. There was also a lot less legroom than I was expecting. I wouldn't recommend putting a bag under the seat in front of you unless it is very small. Since it was morning we were served breakfast. Our drinks were served first along with the standard snack bag that's also served in coach. Then the meals were served. The meal was an egg and bacon French toast sandwich. It was okay but not very filling. I was expecting more for first class.,,,First Class,,,2,4,2,,,2,yes
Alaska Airlines,,Richard Wooden,22nd August 2013,Horrible experience transferring from Flight 456 arriving in Los Angeles to Flight 4213 going to San Jose CA. Boarding pass said Skywest but it was actually American Eagle. On arrival at LAX there was no information about either Skywest no indication where it was located and no one who seemed to know. Asked a gate agent who told us it was terminal 8. She did not say it was American Eagle we were looking for. After much walking and asking several people a TSA agent said to go to gate 65 and take shuttle bus to American. Upon reaching American we were told to board another bus which took us to a building near but not even attached to terminal 8. The TSA agent and the individual opening the restricted zone for us at gate 65 along with the shuttle bus drivers were the only competent individuals who seemed to know that Skywest was American Eagle in this case.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,4,Myrna Gilbert,18th August 2013,Out of 6 flights on Alaska going from Santa Barbara to Kalispell Montana and back only one flight (S.B. to Portland) was even remotely on time. All the rest departed from a half to full hour after the scheduled time. This is the worst this experienced long time flyer has ever seen.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,4,,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,10,G Cueto,11th August 2013,Exceptional flight from PHL to SEA on Aug 6th. Everything from checking in online using the mobile app to the inflight experience was smooth cheerful and efficient. The new recaro seats in Y class was smartly designed and comfortable as Y class goes. Inflight crew were cheerful and chatty particularly the senior attendant. Virgin America has great amenities on transcon flights but I find Alaska to offer the best service!,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,5,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,B Bachman,8th August 2013,Flew from Bethel AK to Anchorage AK on a 737-400 Combi. Flight left on time and service was great. Flight attendants were very nice and smiled. I purchased a Mediterranean Tapas picnic pack for $6 and it was very good. A couple of days later flew from Anchorage AK to Juneau AK on a lei themed 737-800 which is rare for the route (usually only 737-400s are flown). It was nice having an adjustable headrest but I noticed that the seats on the 737-800 don't recline as much as the seats on the older 737-400. The flight was pretty empty with only 50 passengers. The flight attendants seemed tired and didn't smile as much but the service was still okay. Flight left on time. 737-400 Combi's don't have inflight Wi-Fi but all the 737-800s do for a charge of $4.95 for a single flight pass. Overall Alaska Airlines is a great airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,J Velez,6th August 2013,Departed on time from DCA bound for SEA on a 737-400 window seat 16 impossible to move in or out while other two passengers occupied their respective seats. The individual on the middle seat wore the most puzzling attitude making it absolutely awful to even attempt to exit for a loo break for the 4 plus hour trip. Blame the ludicrous spacing that makes it an absolute necessity to require other passengers to co0operate multiple times during a long flight. From SEA to JUN still a fully loaded aircraft yet uneventful and more pleasant neighbor passengers. JUN to final destination PSG a short hour long hop. A short 30 min delay at SEA. Return PSG by way of WRG then KTN imposed an hour an a half delay due not to weather. We arrived late night at SEA and then off to catch a ride to a local awful Seatac Inn for an overnight layover. Flight back to DCA was more pleasant. FA mobilized quickly to keep the full cabin stocked with minute free snacks beverages in cups and purchased meals. Entertainment was avail at 10 dollars for a shared small screen pad which battery quickly ran out of charge. The DCA to SEA is a long flight on a regularly cramped cabin. The spacing between seats is insufficient for a 155 lb. 6 ft. man to exit the window seat without interfering or annoying uncooperative passengers. It is difficult to hold biological needs for such long travel distances.,,,Economy Class,,,1,5,4,2,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,8,S Tepelekian,17th July 2013,LAX-ANC-LAX. Seats were very comfortable and the staff service was great. They even gave us free peanuts and cookies! Although all of these were good the in-flight entertainment is horrible. It is basically an IPad that you rent at $12. Not worth it. Overall this was a great airline. I would definitely fly Alaska Airlines again.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,2,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,,S Alama,15th July 2013,I flew First Class from Palm Springs to San Francisco on July 7th. I have flown First Class on this route many times in the past with Alaska. In the past they had a great choice of salad or cheese plate on the flight with great service. Now they have totally eliminated that and didn't even bother to ask if anyone wanted a refill on their drink which they served with a cheap bag of pretzels. The flight attendant did everything possible not to walk in First Class but stayed in the galley doing nothing. Standards have gone down on Alaska.,,,First Class,,,3,1,1,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,7,Keith Rands-Allen,9th July 2013,Flew from San Jose to Fairbanks via Seattle. A good trip. Flight was on time. We knew no food was served so took our own. AA guarantee that if you don't receive your bags within 20 minutes of the plane arriving at the gate they will pay compensation ($20 I think). Our bags arrived within this time limit.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,M Haywood,8th July 2013,We flew from Seattle to Las Vegas with a connection in Portland as a direct flight would have meant hanging around too long. As we live in UK we were nervous that flights would be delayed given some negative reviews here. Everything went smoothly and right on time. We were impressed with complimentary drinks service given that similar budget airlines in the UK all charge for drinks. Our return flight direct to Seattle was again on time . We found baggage check in quick and friendly and with the exception of one rather curt stewardess everyone else was absolutely fine.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Nico Gray,7th July 2013,PHX-SEA-PHX. Service was great. They were on time. Boeing 737-800 both ways. I would recommend.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,4,Andre Franca,1st July 2013,SEA-ANC-ORD I consider my two experiences with this airline poor ones! The staff are friendly but flights are often delayed! On board crew seem lost this made me feel very uncomfortable these days you pay for everything extra when you fly them even for the bags. Won't be flying Alaska again unless the price is right.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,2,2,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,10,Susan James,30th June 2013,On time and even had two inflight beverage services from Los Angeles to Seattle. This was economy. On the way back to Los Angeles I flew First Class. Was nice to have a meal.,,,First Class,,,4,4,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,,J Johnson,26th June 2013,"June 2013 LAX-MZT-LAX first class. Horrible check in. One first class line which is really 2 lines that mould into one. We stood for 20 minutes as the line grew longer. Whoever designed this lobby should be forced to deal with it on a busy day. When we finally got to the clerk he was surly if not down right rude. He did not speak two words to us. Off to the ""new"" first class lounge. Small cramped dark. Good bar but the small selection of food looked old and un-appealing. I certainly would not pay to get in. Indifferent staff. Boarding was quick and easy. However after it was announced the rear door had been ""armed"" the crew allowed a first class passenger off the plane to purchase an upgraded ticket for his grandson. So we all sat and waited at least ten minutes for him. Inflight the flight attendants on both trips were excellent: attentive friendly helpful. Nice folks. The food? On the way down a limp salad with what I think were chicken strips and a raspberry soda pop for dressing. On the way back inedible pesto chicken. Absolutely unacceptable for the price of a first class ticket. At MZT it took 35 minutes for our baggage to hit the belt. The counter people were slammed trying to check in outgoing passengers so it was impossible to hold Alaska to its 20 minute guarantee. All in all first class is definitely NOT worth the price and I would not recommend it.",,,First Class,,,3,1,2,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,3,Lee Bruno,26th June 2013,I am retired and am fortunate enough to fly first class extensively and often on a variety of airlines both in the US and Europe. I recently flew first class with my wife round trip from Las Vegas to Anchorage and plan to never fly Alaska again. Every employee I had contact with was pleasant and courteous the planes were on time but the only benefit in flying first was the additional legroom. The outbound and inbound flights were 2 weeks apart but breakfast both mornings was the same and only thing what they called eggs benedict with turkey ham which was on a piece of dry bread and was tasteless. Lunch was also one choice a chicken salad on a tiny salad plate with out bread cracker or chip desert was one piece of rolled candy. There was no TV on the leg of the flight to Seattle to Anchorage they provided a small hand held screen with a choice of 4-5 movies and short clips. I have never had such cheap and thoughtless meals on any of my previous flights. I would never recommend this Airline but if your required to fly it don't waste your money on first class.,,,First Class,,,3,4,1,1,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,9,Streb Lovell,16th June 2013,SEA-MFR via PDX then PDX-SEA. All flights on time. Service great. No complaints except maybe the skimpy selection of beverages but these are such short flights.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,W Coenik,13th June 2013,Flew from Honolulu to Newark return in First. Flew Alaska last year in first and was so impressed booked with them again. Great service and the meals are just some of the best I have had on a plane. Flights were on time except for a delay because of weather but that's flying for you. Cant blame the airline for that. The staff are helpful and polite. Love the small first class of only 16 seats. Makes it feel like being on a small business jet as very individual service. Again well done to Alaska and would fly with them again.,,,First Class,,,4,5,5,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,R Hesser,2nd June 2013,"SJC-OGG SJC-LIH SAN-BOS return in F on relatively new 737-800 aircraft. While Alaska planes may not have the ""bells and whistles"" of JetBlue or Virgin America Alaska succeeds by running a very reliable operation offering a decent inflight product and friendly service. From Bay Area to Hawaii I was able to upgrade to First via online check-in for $100. Worth every penny! Check-in was fast and no charge for 2 bags. On board pre-flight beverages offered and menus were distributed. Mid-range wine choices but glasses were kept refilled throughout. The Alaskan Amber beer is quite good too. Breakfast served in 2 courses and Lunch/Dinner in 3 courses and the pace of service was quite relaxed. A snack later in the flight. Food and portions were very good on all flights. Crew were very polite and addressed passengers by last name. One FA even personally thanked each passenger for their business at the end. IFE consisted of a ""digeplayer"" providing a wide choice. The touchscreen worked well and the picture was clear although the sound quality will be much better if you bring your own headphones. F seats are basic domestic F but the extra width and legroom certainly make the upgrade worthwhile. Best part is their excellent on-time performance. I've only encountered 2 delays in the past 30+ flights.",,,First Class,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,,T Jedlicka,2nd June 2013,We have been trying for two days to get to Fairbanks and have spent 15 hours in airports and not there yet. There has been delay after delay and none of them weather related. The delays and cancellations have all been maintenance and crew problems which seem to be a systemic problem with Alaska Airlines starting with their top management. This is Sunday and I tried to talk to a supervisor in the Anchorage Airport and was told that supervisors aren't available on Sunday.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,Gordon McFarlane,27th May 2013,Victoria - Seattle - Maui return in First Class. The service was impeccable and breakfast on the outbound flight was very good and spread out over a couple of hours which helped pass the time. Lunch on the inbound flight was equally good with a choice of sirloin steak or sweet and sour chicken. Frequent offers of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages throughout the flights. Individual entertainment tablets with a wide range of films and TV shows. Attendants were very friendly and attentive. All the flights departed on time and arrived on time. This is the first time travelling on Alaska First Class and it was well worth the additional cost. My only disappointment was The Boardroom at Sea-Tac. It was pretty drab with a poor choice of food/snacks (both in the morning and early evening). It is certainly not worth $45 a visit. It is not a patch on Air Canada's Maple Leaf lounges.,,,First Class,,,4,5,5,5,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,Natasha Powell,26th May 2013,LAX to DCA on May 23rd. Apart from one every other flight attendant was rude and scowled the whole trip. No greeting as we boarded the plane no follow through with promises to help provide first aid (or a simple bandaid after an injury) and no explanation for delays that occurred. The attendants seemed annoyed when customers asked for beverages when we were seemingly skipped. Overall this flight is miserable and the staff are far less pleasant than the attendants who work for foreign or even domestic airlines that I have flown with recently. Granted the lack of amenities on this older flight doesn't add much to the comfort of fl going across country but a pleasant attitude for the staff wouldn't hurt.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,2,1,,4,no
Alaska Airlines,,Nicole Sherman,10th May 2013,My flight from Honolulu to San Jose was delayed 2.5 hours today which made me miss my connecting flight to Atlanta. They then told me there were no flight tonight to the east coast yet while I was sitting with an employee waiting for new boarding passes for tomorrow a flight to New York was boarding right next to me. Not a full flight either! They changed my flight but then brought me outside to wait for a shuttle to a hotel. I was left on the curb with 5 suitcases and a duffel bag and waited an hour. I finally called the hotel and they told me the shuttle had stopped running at midnight. I ended up having to take a taxi to the hotel. The next day when I was boarding my new flight I had to pay to check my bags again. All in all I paid 60$ extra for re checking my bags a 15 dollar cab and absolutely no sleep. They had absolutely horrible customer service and late flights.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,10,Steven Montgomery,25th April 2013,After a very unsatisfying flight on Delta from ATL to SEA it was a privilege to board our Alaska Airlines flight to ANC. Not only the extra legroom and comfort of the aircraft but the excellent cabin crew made me forget the horrible service Delta had just delivered.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,A Whittle,23rd April 2013,"Round trip SAN/PVR April 4-12. Alaska's first is more of a ""light first"". Seats and legroom just so so. Same pasta dish on both legs served along side a small salad. No roll butter or dessert. Flight attendants on both legs were great they seemed embarrassed about the meal quality but kept drinks flowing and were very pleasant. Both flights on time. Travelled on BA award tickets.",,,First Class,,,3,5,2,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,Stephen G Sweet,22nd April 2013,ANC to RNO with stop in SEA. I must admit that I was pleased with Alaska and Horizon Air in both directions. I flew their 737/8 on the way down and the 900 model on return. Planes were clean service was much better than I have had in the past. If they keep it up I may end up with them again soon. Good job and a decent price for what I received.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Nathan Green,21st April 2013,I flew from SEA to PHX the flight was great the ground staff and inflight staff very accommodating. They give out free snacks and a choice to purchase a inflight meal/snack. I will be flying Alaska Airlines again.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,,M Dayan,16th April 2013,We travelled overnight from Seattle to Orlando and were seated in the very back row of the plane. These seats are hard up against the back wall of the plane and do not recline. It was a most uncomfortable trip I can remember and would definitely recommend avoiding travelling with Alaskan Air.,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,3,2,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,5,Ellen Johnson,2nd April 2013,I flew to Las Vegas March 29th and returned April 1. First class round-trip $777. Service down was slow and we were served a cheese platter. Not a significant midday meal but it was sufficient. Returning was worse. Nearly an hour before cocktails were delivered. We were not served the cheese platter. We were served hot pasta in cheese sauce on a sad looking salad bed. I asked the Flight Attendant for the cheese platter instead as I heard them offering it to the coach passengers. She advised that I would have to pay for it. She was rude and smug. Apparently I can drink you dry of scotch but have to pay additional for a decent meal. In addition after being served our drinks another Flight Attendant came up to us and asked if we wanted our pretzel bags as they did not have enough to serve coach. I have been flying Alaska Airlines since 1973. This is the worst service I have received coach or first class. Flying 1st class is more than a wider seat. It represents a gracious and superior attention to the passengers for which a premium is being paid.,,,First Class,,,4,1,2,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,M Wharfe,1st April 2013,Shuttle flight from Seattle to Portland and we missed the original connection as our international flight was late. AS couldn't have done more to help us and got us on the standby list on loaded and even sat together. Quick flight friendly crew and always my first choice for us domestic flights.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,,Scott Bourne,26th March 2013,Flew from Anchorage to Seattle with a seat on a plane from Seattle to Vegas. The weather was bad in Anchorage but the pilot assured us we'd make our connections. Got to the gate in Vegas 21 minutes before the flight was set to leave. The Las Vegas crew was alerted that 45 of us from the Anchorage plane were bound for Vegas. The gate agent would not let us on the plane. Smiled smugly and said sorry. We all went to the customer service centre where a man told us we were lucky to get seats on the 9.35 flight. While I was at customer service I noticed the Vegas plane was still at the gate - 20 minutes later. I paid almost $1800 for this experience. Clearly Alaska Airlines isn't interested in customer service.,,,First Class,,,3,1,3,4,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,10,S Symon,26th March 2013,DCA-LAX on a 737-800. Plane pushed back from the gate 15 minutes before scheduled departure time and was in the air right on time (I can't remember the last time this has happened). Aircraft was very clean and the leather seats were very comfortable. The crew did 3 drink runs and we received plenty of updates from the flight deck which I always appreciate. Will definitely consider flying them again since they have a codeshare agreement with American Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,5,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,G Johnson,22nd March 2013,Seattle to Maui return. Planes departed on time and arrived slightly early both ways. Baggage was already waiting for us when we arrived in claim area. Attendants were very courteous and pleasant. Food purchased was just fine-deli pack. I usually travel Alaska if possible and have not had anything to complain about. They have always departed on time and done a good job!,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,Ned Hopkins,22nd March 2013,"SFO-SJD return. The flight to Los Cabos left and arrived on time the return flight left half an hour early but was required to circle SFO for almost as long before landing. Snacks on the 2hr 40min flights were edible nothing more. FAs were attentive. Seats were comfortable but legroom was as tight as any I've experienced in a first class (or business class) cabin. Alaska now departs from the new SJD terminal it lacks some of the features - dining options in particular - that made the ""old"" one a pleasant place to await boarding.",,,First Class,,,4,5,3,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,S Koenig,15th March 2013,First class KOA-PDX. Flight was on time. Seats fine. Food fine. In-flight entertainment (individual hand- held devices) fine. Nothing spectacular but we had no complaints. We chose Alaska over Hawaiian because it was fully refundable in first class and also non-stop from Kona to Portland where as Hawaiian was not unless you purchased a much more expensive ticket.,,,First Class,,,4,4,4,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,M Silva Green,13th March 2013,Staff indifferent and rude. We had a 4 hour delay from Kona to Portland and they offered no inflight freebies to compensate. Going to Maui they kept serving alcohol to passengers that were drunk.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,2,2,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,2,Barbara A Hestdalen,7th March 2013,Alaska Air has a bad reputation because of frequent flight delays. We weren't surprised when our flight was delayed several hours in Kelowna BC on Feb 22nd. We then missed our connections in Seattle and in Portland to Maui Hawaii. After all the delays we were looking forward to finally boarding our flight to Maui and sitting in our first class seats for which we had paid a lot of extra money. What a disappointment! It was an old dirty plane with the most uncomfortable seats we have ever experienced. The seats were old and worn and lacked cushioning. To top it off the backs reclined only about 5 degrees. The inflight entertainment was of such poor quality we couldn't use it - the audio and screen were awful. We are vegetarians and Alaska Air only offers fish and chicken. The good thing about the flight were the flight attendants who were pleasant and cheerful. We arrived in Maui and because of all the delays we were up 24 hours before being able to finally get to bed. So all in all we were not happy customers. Alaska needs to improve their planes and give much more thought to passenger comfort and service. We have been to Hawaii 20+ times on other airlines and never had such an uncomfortable flight as on Alaska.,,,First Class,,,1,4,3,1,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,6,Lizabeth Southworth,21st February 2013,I recently flew round-trip from Boston to Seattle on Alaska Airlines. I was happy that we: 1) arrived safely 2) arrived on-time. I didn't check a bag so cannot rate their handling of my luggage. I was surprised to learn that even on longer haul flights in-flight entertainment was not complimentary as it is on other airlines. In addition the food offerings had no hot meal suitable for a vegetarian at any meal. My seat on the flight to SEA was very uncomfortable but adequate on the return flight. Alaska Airlines got the major points right but there's plenty of room for improvement!,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,2,1,,,no
Alaska Airlines,3,J Cranford,20th February 2013,LAX-SJD-LAX Feb 15 First Class. What a disappointing experience. We purchased (not upgraded or miles) first class tickets to Cabo expecting a lot more. The first class seat pitch was awful in rows 2 and 3. Very cramped! Forget it if the person in front of you leans back at all. It also appears that the 3rd (and last row of 1st) has minimal seat recline. The condition of the seats : The leather was very distressed marked up and very worn. When we boarded at Cabo for the return flight to LAX there were crumbs all over the seats and floor. The food (both ways): a chicken sandwich with a single tomato slice some orzo and a piece of chocolate. Not even packets of salt and pepper accompanied the trays. I'd say this product is an embarrassment to this airline.,,,First Class,,,2,3,2,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,,Tess Smith,19th February 2013,Flight was late on both legs of round trip. The food advertised was not available and what was available they ran out of so we could not feed our 3 yrs old. When my husband complained the flight attendant happened to find something. There should be enough food for the passengers especially when you're landing at 10.30pm.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,1,3,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,10,C Adams,16th January 2013,The day we were to depart was a bad weather day for the North Eastern part of the country and the aircraft we were to take from Reagan International was delayed due to weather. When we arrived at the airport shortly before the flight I received a call regarding this delay. When we finally go to the ticket counter the agent informed us that we would more than likely miss our connecting flight and they wanted us to depart from Dulles. After speaking to the customer service agent we were informed of the situation and they would pay for a taxi to get to Dulles send our bags and upgrade us on the United flight to first class. We got to Dulles with time to spare boarded our flight and got to California early enough to get a good nights rest before catching our connection. End result we arrived to our destination refreshed on time and ready. Our luggage arrived with us as well.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,G Cueto,10th January 2013,DCA-SEA Dec 24 Y class. Orderly bordering and flight left on time (it helped that DCA was practically empty at 5pm on Christmas eve). Seats clean and definitely provided more legroom than my United flight a few weeks later. Service efficient but nothing extraordinary. Solid and consistent performance.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,3,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,,Suzanne Allemeier,8th January 2013,Just flew from Vancouver to San Diego via LAX with Alaska. 2nd segment was with a Delta Regional operating for Alaska. My bag which was checked through did not arrive. Airport rep said it was the 3rd day in a row this had happened on the Vancouver flight. When I called Alaska to find out why this known problem was not addressed and why I was the third day victim the rep kept trying to tell me it was Delta's fault and then hung up on me.,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,8,A Craig,8th January 2013,BLI to HNL on 26 December 2012. Alaska's in-flight staff were excellent on this flight. Three beverage services and free mai tai's before landing. The rented Digiplayer was delivered promptly after take-off. Staff were all very cheerful and did their best to make our flight enjoyable. Excellent work.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,R Crawford,3rd January 2013,Excellent flight on new 739-900ER yesterday (AS 109) from SEA to ANC. Excellent crew and great service all in light on a very bumpy flight due to strong winds along the route. Last few flights on AS have really been good with on time departures and arrivals.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,,Jannie Every,21st December 2012,I have been sitting in Calgary airport for 4 hours with little communication from the staff as to what is going on. First they have us board the plane and the plane is not even functioning. Then they have us sit on the plane for over an hour before telling us what is going on. Then finally they instruct everyone to get off the plane and wait. And wait. And still waiting. Finally an hour later they board us again saying everything is repaired and we are ready to go. Oh but wait we are still sitting here waiting with no communication from the flight team. I will never fly them again.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,3,A Chun,20th December 2012,I flew from DFW to Seattle then on to Honolulu. Interior of the planes are shabby and worn. Seats are hard and narrow with minimum recline. No pillows blankets or footrests. FA tossed a bag of mixed nuts toward my hubby by the window seat couldn't she have handed it to him?,,,First Class,,,2,2,3,2,,,no
Alaska Airlines,2,Alex Hill,17th December 2012,I started flying another airline about 2 years ago but today decided to give Alaska another chance. I was sorely disappointed. The ticketing agents greeted me with frowns and a cold mechanical demeanour. The woman managing the line was condescending and seemed irritated with everyone. When I boarded I found my seat 3-A to not fully recline. The amount of leg room wasn't enough to cross my leg at the ankle and the general appearance was worn out and dirty. Once we were in the air the man in front of me reclined and I was no longer able to reach my bag under the seat. Now I would expect this in a coach seat but again they're calling this first class. I was served a lacklustre although well presented breakfast of eggs with tomato and asparagus a potato cake and fresh (ish) fruit. The flight attendant in my cabin was prompt and polite but the announcement about Alaska air credit cards droned on for what seemed like an eternity. Alaska built a reputation with exceptional customer service and a clean well maintained fleet of aircraft. Today booth there workforce and equipment seems to be in need of a serious overhaul.,,,First Class,,,1,3,3,1,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,7,W Smith,5th December 2012,I fly Alaska a lot - MVP Gold for several consecutive years. I maintain this status mainly through partner airline miles. The main reason I stick with Alaska is that they have direct flights to two of my primary destinations from SEA where other airlines have stops in between. Service on Alaska is wildly variable. One flight will be the best service I can remember and the very next flight will be painful and unpleasant. So - if you are lucky and get a newer aircraft and a good crew you are good to go. If on the other hand you get one of the worn-out planes and/or a crew that couldn't care less if you were there or not.,,,First Class,,,3,3,4,3,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,7,C Logiacco,26th November 2012,Flew from SFO to Seattle Seattle to LA and then Seattle to SFO. Check in and boarding was seamless - for each flight we departed either on time or ahead of the scheduled departure time and luggage was always ready to be picked up within 20 mins of exiting the aircraft. Flight crew are friendly. Will fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,,Varsha Agarwal,30th October 2012,SFO to Seattle. Printed my boarding pass and was waiting to board my late night flight back to Seattle which was delayed by 3 hours. When I checked my options for changing the flight I was told its a non refundable ticket and to change was $100. Staff do not appear trained to be polite and offer service. We waited for passengers from a connecting flight to arrive this consumed another 30 minutes.,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,1,2,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,10,D Winkowski,8th October 2012,I choose Alaska over United on my flights from LAX to PDX or SEA because they fly 737 and not commuters and offer a better Coach product than United. Crew seems happy to be there and they have hot food to purchase with good coffee! Having Wifi is a plus as well.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,H McTyre,30th September 2012,SEA-ANC return in First. On the way up Anchorage was expecting bad weather. The FAs who had already delayed providing any first class service until about 50 minutes into the flight decided more than an hour out of ANC to prepare the cabin for landing. They got on the overhead and informed everyone that the captain had ordered this then promptly ceased service closed the restrooms and plopped down in their jump seats to chat. (This was clearly visible from First.) About a half hour of smooth flying later the pilot got on the intercom and announced that the FAs should begin preparing the cabin for arrival. It was obvious he had no idea the FAs had ceased working 30 minutes earlier. Alaska really needs to do something about its FAs. They used to be the best in the business such that it was a real treat to get to fly Alaska on this leg; now this route in particular is staffed by burnouts. I get better treatment on Delta for my Alaska frequent flyer status than I do on Alaska.,,,First Class,,,3,1,1,2,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,4,R Kornacki,28th September 2012,Traveled to and from Anchorage from Kansas City in Sep 2012. Amazing to find the Alaska Airlines structures built in several airports to squeeze hold baggage fees from customers - but poorly staffed. Lines were longer when standing in line to check bags where baggage fees had been earlier paid on the web by credit card. On the full flight back from Anchorage to Seattle on 17 September I don't know that I have ever been packed tighter in an aircraft. I am not a tall man and my knees were in contact with the seat in front of me for that uncomfortable 3 hour leg. I know the economy is tough and the airline business intent upon wringing the last buck they can from the consumer but Alaska Airlines has taken this to a new level. I felt for the flight attendants hawking meals video devices and other such up and down the aisle. In Seattle prior to the last leg to Kansas City they gave us a start by posting a 7 hour delay- with no explanation whatever. Fortunately after 20 minutes of angst the original departure time was reinstated. I last traveled to Alaska on Alaska Airlines quite a few years ago and the present experience in coach was like night and day.,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,3,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,W Coenik,26th September 2012,Flew Newark to Honolulu via Seattle and Bellingham First Class. First time with Alaska. Very impressive. Seats comfortable food was great. The flight from Bellingham to Honolulu had the best airline food I have had. The crew were friendly on all legs. One thing that did annoy was that even though an announcement was made at the start of each flight that the front toilet was for first class only during the flight Economy passengers would use it and not be stopped. The digeplayer was not up to the standard of in seat units and did not have a good selection. But overall excellent flights. Would fly with them again.,,,First Class,,,5,5,5,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,6,D Mauro,18th September 2012,Alaska Airlines is slightly better than other major U.S. carriers. Like the legacy carriers they have also done away with blankets entertainment and free coach food. Fortunately flight attendants were actually kind and I did find the seats to be noticeably more comfortable. Having a friendly smiling crew and a nice seat made quite a difference.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,2,2,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,D Harper,17th September 2012,"Heading to Disneyland for our daughter's sixth birthday. Planned well in advance and when it comes to checking in they have separated the three of us with their updated seat assignment. We all have the same last name an it clearly states that we're travelling with a child. Get to the gate only to be told by the agent that she can't do anything and we should ask the flight attendants to find us seats together. We get in the plane and explain the situation to the flight attendants and they now tell us that hey can't do anything and we're out of luck. ""Maybe someone will be nice enough to switch seats with you"". Is this really how you handle mistakes? By passing the buck and doing nothing? A complete disappointment from a company that has obviously forgotten what customer service means.",,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,David Passmore,3rd September 2012,I booked a one way trip from Seattle to Los Angeles and after reading some of the negative comments I was a little concerned. It turned out my worries were unfounded. I booked my trip online some time before the trip and got a very reasonable price. I was able to select seats on reservation and was able to change them when checking in online. On arrival at Seatac check in was smooth and swift and the boarding process was well organised. Staff on board were pleasant and informative and I found the on board wi-fi excellent - and cheaper than what some hotels charge! All in all a very pleasant flight and would certainly use Alaska again without any hesitation.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,2,Shelley Bogaert,30th August 2012,One way from San Diego to Seattle in first class. I paid approximately $450 for the seat. The extent of the food service on the 2.5 hour flight was a fruit and cheese plate. Pitiful to describe and worse to eat. There was also absolutely no in-flight entertainment no headsets and no video.,,,First Class,,,3,4,1,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,2,J Levy,29th August 2012,We were very disappointed during our 4 weeks trip around Alaska and way to Hawaii with Alaska Airlines. We used it for many flights. SEA-JUN JUN-CVA CVA-ANC Fairbanks-Barrow Anchorage-HNL and HNL-SEA and always the same opinion. Old dated planes service near zero (no free meals) just peanuts and drinks. You have to pay for your luggage when you don't travel only around Alaska: for us a total of 80 USD. More over no entertainment you have to pay 10$ to watch old movies. To conclude crew not very friendly.,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,1,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,1,Baining Guo,7th August 2012,I already checked into my flight and got my boarding pass at the airport. However with Alaska you have to wait in line to pay for your luggage separately (is this something new?). By the time it was my turn to pay for my luggage they said my luggage was too late for the flight. The luggage needs to be paid and checked in 40 min before the flight. As a result they took my boarding pass away and switch me to a flight 8 hrs later. Because of the huge delay my business activities all have to be sacrificed.,,,First Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,1,Joseph Stewart,7th August 2012,I showed up 2 hours early but a TSA-Alaska problem made me miss my flight. Their small print symbol calling for additional security screening was missed by TSA so when I went to board they had to send me back to TSA and I missed my flight. The worst part is that they wouldn't put me on the next flight to my destination (on another airline) and made me wait 5+ hours for another Alaska flight. I would have been better off driving. I'll avoid flying with Alaska air in the future if I can.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,1,Anne Taplin,16th July 2012,My husband and I were refused to fly because he had an airline approved oxygenator to take on as hand luggage and it would not be used in flight. We had purchased First class tickets to from Seattle to Hawaii they put us on another Airline those seats were economy and the cost of those tickets were $360.00 pp and we had paid over $700 pp - they gave us a refund of $105 pp.,,,First Class,,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,2,Brian Parker,9th July 2012,LAX-PDX-BLI and BLI-SEA-SFO. All flights were completely full. Comfort on all aircraft's was surprisingly good. What lets them down is the staff. Robotic flight attendants going through the motions. Check-in staff in Bellingham were agonizingly slow. There were only two customers in front of me. 20 mins later there were still two customers in front of me. When I finally reached the counter my bag was 50.7 pounds. I am told to re-pack it. I took one shoe out of my suitcase and put it in my carry-on and she accepted my suitcase. On both Horizon Air flights (PDX-BLI-SEA) flight attendants sat in their jumpseats and read magazines the entire flight. My Alaska Seattle-San Francisco flight ended up arriving over an hour late. I had to run through SFO to catch my Air New Zealand flight. What a pleasure to be greeted at the door of Air NZ by smiling polite cabin crew.,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,2,1,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,4,L Melbourne,8th July 2012,Found planes to be aged and shabby. Tray tables dirty would not want to eat off them. Staff seemed friendly but their uniforms were unimpressive. Had a delay out of Seattle and everyone was made to get off plane travel by train to another terminal to board another plane because of a broken seat. This was obviously known about before we boarded so they should not have put that plane back into service before it was fixed. Would not recommend this airline.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,2,,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,2,K Lutz,5th July 2012,Previously I have had mostly positive experiences with Alaska Airlines. However over an hour after boarding the plane we are still sitting at the gate waiting for maintenance and my 16 month old is getting fussy. I ask the FA if she can get us some juice to calm him down and am told no even though she is serving coffee to other passengers. 30 minutes later we are still sitting there and he is seeing everyone else getting drinks but him and starts to cry at which point the FA comes back and tells me to make him be quiet. I fly with my son almost twice a month and have never had a problem. On any other airline they would have tried to help the situation by talking to him or bringing a snack or a pair of wings. But not this one.,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,1,3,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,1,Dan Franklin,5th July 2012,Being based in Portland I am stuck traveling Alaska 75% of the time for business travel and was never impressed with the quality of the planes or service. Recently I used rewards miles for a trip to Honolulu. The plane was a standard 737 with absolutely no amenities. The overhead air barely blew. Service was terrible. Based on the most recent experience with their customer service I will try even harder to not fly Alaska and I am cancelling their rewards credit card. The other 25% I travel United and have never had a problem with their planes or service.,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,3,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,5,Jade West,2nd July 2012,I flew in from round trips OAK to HNL both flights were awful. The money I paid for these two flight's were great and that's the main reason I'm not too hateful towards them. The food was not bad. The staff service was good. The main reason my experience with Alaska Airlines was awful is because the actual aircraft's I flew in were horrible! The seats were incredibly small I was feeling very cramped during the whole flight's it was impossible to sleep on those plane's because the recliner's barely reclined. The leg room was ridiculous it's really hard to get up and go to the lavatory. The lavatory is also a bit small. There was not any complimentary in-flight entertainment expect the crew members offered screens to watch movies shows etc with a 10$ fee. Overall Alaska Airlines is mediocre. If you want a good price to go to Hawaii but understand that you will suffer cramped seats for 5 and half hours fly Alaska Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,4,3,,5,no
Alaska Airlines,1,D Livak,1st July 2012,Flew SFO to SEA. My 9.20am flight was over sold. I was bumped to another flight leaving from OAK 5 hours later. My return flight left 5 hours late after changing planes twice because of mechanical problems. Worst flight experience I have had on many years and I fly 50000 plus miles a year. I haven't flown Alaska in 20 years and I never will again.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,1,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,1,Olivia Lane,12th June 2012,I would not recommend Frontier for those with connections. My flight from BNA-SFO with a connection in Denver was grounded because of plane problems. We were grounded in St Louis and agents were most unhelpful. I was stuck in St Louis and only got to my destination because I booked other flights in order to do so. Frontier does not do anything but give a 200 voucher for a missed connection. On my way back from SFO to BNA (connecting through Denver) we were grounded for a medical emergency which is understandable however no help given to those who missed connections. I got home on my own doing by booking a Southwest flight while we were grounded in Grand Junction. They have limiting options to help you out if you miss a connection.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,4,4,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,9,D Smith,11th June 2012,MCI-SEA-ANC- May 2012. All flights on time no delays. Had an excellent Tuscan pasta dish. Return was also without hitch long layover in SEA but got passes to the Boardroom and enjoyed to space and quiet. All of our flights on Alaska have been positive and enjoyable.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,3,Steven Gilbert,5th June 2012,I was flying from DCA to SAN with a connection in Denver. DCA to DEN was a nice enough flight with no complaints. However when my flight from DEN to SAN came they were unable to get a pilot. Keep in mind that DEN is Frontier's hub. This occurred at 10.10 pm and by the time I was able to speak with customer service the earliest flight that I could get to SAN was 9 pm the next day. Fortunately I did not have plans the next day but I know several people in the line who had to miss out on their plans due to this.,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,8,Nikolas Lazar,4th June 2012,Overall my flight was very pleasant. The crew were nice and friendly and for the most part the plane was clean. They forgot the digeplayers however and the wifi was iffy so definitely bring a ipad along with you with non-wifi apps. The headrests are annoying for shorter passenger as they are literally a pain in the neck. Overall Alaska Airlines was a cheap alternative to other airlines to Seattle.,,,Economy Class,,,2,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,2,K Danenhauer,31st May 2012,"I bought tickets to fly myself and my 2 young kids (ages 4 and 2) from Salt Lake to Kansas City 2 months in advance. Inexplicably Frontier did not assign us seats together. For each of the 4 legs on this round-trip gate agents did a little shuffling to get us in the same row. But I still had to personally ask other people already on their seats to move. Travelling alone this wouldn't have been a big deal but with two little kids? Just getting on the plane and taking care of everyone's food potty and entertainment needs is stressful enough. Frontier made this such an unpleasant experience that I will avoid getting any tickets on Frontier again. When I said something about this to a flight attendant I got the response ""Well that's Frontier for you!""",,,Economy Class,,,1,2,2,1,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,5,R Dunham,21st May 2012,LAX-SEA-LAX-GDL in First Class. Alaska served the same meal consisting of a Chicken Sandwich and orzo pasta salad on all sectors. I was especially disappointed on the International sector of LAX-GDL. Alaska Airlines was on time for all sectors baggage was delivered promptly and the inflight cabin staff were efficient. They have to learn to vary their menu for First Class Passengers especially on International Sectors. Thus the mediocre rating.,,,First Class,,,3,4,2,,,3,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,G Zett,9th May 2012,PDX-LGB return. While the flight was technically on SkyWest it is abundantly clear that this is an Alaska Air operation from the plane livery to the standard level of service given - which is to say a cut above. Clean CRJ planes 2x beverage service - no charge for microbrew beer or Pacific Northwest wines arrived on time with not much fuss. Only quibbles were the standard narrow CRJ seating and any food other than a package of pretzels had to be purchased. I liked the fact that the counter person suggested I check my bag plane- side avoiding the ridiculous $20 surcharge on all counter-checked luggage.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Mike Archambault,3rd May 2012,OGG-SEA-BOS First Class. Flying in first class and not having to worry about paying $18 for the video player plus 2 suitcases each was almost worth it. We boarded on time and were given a plastic cup of water. The flight attendant took our coats and was polite and attentive. He let us know our food choices and was very attentive throughout the flight. We arrived early into SEA and had a 3 hour layover we went to the first class lounge in another terminal but had time to kill. Free food relaxing and comfortable lounge was appreciated. We boarded on time for BOS and again were given great service and lots of attention. I was pleased with my time in first class and just booked again for our return next Feb.,,,First Class,,,4,5,4,4,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,C Cleven,24th April 2012,ATL-SEA in First Class. Lamb dinner was very good. Service excellent. New version of Digiplayer entertainment system is a big improvement. Left on time arrived a little early. Seat comfortable. Couldn't ask for much more.,,,First Class,,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,2,Geronimo Saagun,24th April 2012,I am a 75K elite status on this Airline and fly every weekend and also 1 million miler status since two years ago but sadly have seen a dramatic decline in service. First class not worth the cost. Upgrades even with my status are rare. Food is horrible. I recommend you stick with either American or Delta or United or Southwest for elite status. MVP Gold and 75K means nothing to the airline.,,,First Class,,,3,3,1,4,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,2,C Odonnell,24th April 2012,I have been an Alaska Airlines MVP Gold passenger for 6 years. Each year the service and attitude slips in the past 2 years more than ever in crew attitude food portions and quality. The routes I fly for business are SEA-ANC SEA-DCA and SEA-LAZ. Last two round trips one to DCA and to LAX were especially bad. The plane had not been well serviced the food was not up to standard and FA's did not care about the over heated cabin. The sorry truth is that on the SEA-ANC and SEA-WDC flights Alaska knows that they can be poor and still outshine their competitors.,,,First Class,,,2,,2,,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,3,D Allen,11th April 2012,We flew from Bellingham to Honolulu HI and back with Alaska Airlines. On the flight to HI we sat in row 23. By the time the food service got to us (I was willing to pay for food) they were out of the good food and only had things that no one else wanted to buy. Lousy service lousy prices. Late leaving HI for Bellingham by 30 minutes. This airline continues to go down hill. Years ago it was a great airline. Not so much anymore.,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,3,2,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,6,R Crawford,15th March 2012,Cost-cutting measures are showing more and more. Although first class is quite expensive it really isn't worth the extra expense anymore except for the larger seats and increased legroom. Meal service is a shadow of what it used to be just a few years ago. A recent flight from Anchorage to Seattle features a chicken curry salad that was frightful while the nice desserts have shrunk to a small piece of candy. Not impressed.,,,First Class,,,3,3,3,4,,2,yes
Alaska Airlines,2,Jason Macnair,12th March 2012,Terrible Airline cheap with bad service. My plane landed in Seattle for a connecting flight at 10.40pm my connecting flight left at 11.00pm. Though the flight staff announced that all those people who needed to get on connecting flights be let off the plane first none of the passengers complied when we landed. Flight staff did nothing to ensure that folks who needed to get connecting flights got to them on time. I ended up at my gate at 10.55pm though flight staff closed the gate anyway no apology no help.,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,3,3,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,2,T Sauve,29th February 2012,We flew to Mexico in coach. Both ways they ran out of food and we were at the front of the plane row 8. Trying to get one of the attendants to serve you for a drink is a nightmare. We have flown many times and each time it goes down hill further. Our next flight is in First Class so lets see if it is any better. After reading the reviews I am not holding my breath.,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,1,1,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,1,K Hazelip,23rd February 2012,First Class is an expensive joke. An ageing fleet makes for poor seats and amenities. Food is poor - both legs of our first class trip brought the reality that only some in first class are allowed to order from the menu. For both legs we were given food that was unwanted and in fact inedible.,,,First Class,,,3,2,1,3,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,4,A Singh,9th January 2012,YEG-SEA-LAX both flights were considerably disappointing. Food - all I had was a small snack. Drinks were good. Flight Attendants were hit and miss in responding to requests. There was no inflight entertainment. Seats weren't very comfortable with little to no space.,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,2,1,,3,no
Alaska Airlines,3,S Oesterblad,26th October 2011,I filled out everything from seat number to meal preference it turned out to be a waste of time. There is no food other than pricey snacks and the seats assigned at check-in. I was taken back by the lack of free onboard movies instead you have to purchase that too. As well as being turned away from using lavatory in front of airplane - that's reserved for higher paying customers. So not having been on Alaska in sometime I was very disappointed.,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,2,2,,2,no
Alaska Airlines,8,P Sorli,24th October 2011,YVR-LAX-YVR. Both flights relatively full and on-time. Great service FAs and surprisingly comfortable seats (though narrow). The only negative thing to point out is their terminal in LAX which is not good at all - overcrowded and dirty.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,,,5,yes
Alaska Airlines,2,H McTyre,21st October 2011,ANC-SFO-PSP-ANC First Class. Flight attendants do not serve first class like first class. It's more like you're time warped back into what Coach used to be like. Drinks on offer before takeoff - tepid water poured out of an open common bottle into a plastic cup. Service after takeoff indifferent. Food not great. Interestingly if you request an alcoholic drink they bring you two mini-bottles of the alcohol but don't bring you the can of tonic/soda/whatever that goes with it so you can mix it yourself. Planes are exceedingly loud with announcements from FAs but if the pilot speaks you can't hear a word. Between that and the thin rocky seats make sure you pack your ibuprofen.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,10,Renee Skafte,21st October 2011,My family and I were scheduled to traveled from DC to Seattle this week but we accidentally went to the wrong airport. Our mistake completely however you would have never guessed that considering the way the ground crew treated us. They immediately got us rescheduled on another flight to LA and on again to Seattle. They made sure we had our seats together as much as possible and were as hospitable as could possibly be. I've always felt that our prior experiences on Alaska Air were always good but I was truly impressed with their service on this last trip. I am certain that we would not have had such luck on any other airline. I want to thank Alaska Air for making a possible bad situation a positive and comfortable day for us.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,B Thomas,20th October 2011,I've had to fly Alaska almost every Monday morning and Thursday evening for the past 2.5 months from Seattle to Oakland because of a project I was on. Their miles plan is quite generous and I will continue to book with them. Consistently good things about Alaska are their customer service quality (always respectful and accommodating) and on-time flight status (not one single late flight with the exception of a bomb threat which isn't their fault). Consistent areas for improvement with Alaska are their seat comfort (the adjustable headrests are good on the larger planes but the smaller ones lack them and the seat bottoms across are painfully hard across the board - a 1.5 hour flight should not have me in physical pain at the end of it) their wi-fi offerings (there is no way I am paying $10 for slow internet access for 1.5 hours; that's absurd) and their MVP Gold status is so heavily overloaded now that it seems like the majority of the flight is boarded early by them rather than normal flyers (they need to consider revising how these points are earned and applied). Overall I have enjoyed them however and I will continue to use them for my return flights now that my weekly commute has moved to a Seattle-to-Houston trip (there are no nonstop flights going to Houston on Sunday afternoons with Alaska or its partner airlines so I'll have to get there using Continental and come back on Alaska which is fine).,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,Helen Canny,14th October 2011,I flew 6 hrs from Seattle to Kona on a full flight. The only toilets for economy were at the back of the plane. Being only one narrow aisle there was continual crowding and congestion up the aisle near the toilets. It was particularly bad for passengers in the back rows because they had people in the aisle crowding them the whole flight. We were not allowed to use the first class facilities at the front even though a couple of people did go through. An other annoyance was the frequency and volume of announcements. Please let us have some peace and quiet! We noticed the contrast with Hawaiian Airlines which was so tranquil and relaxing with no loud publicity of special deals and unnecessary announcements of impending drinks trolley.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,no
Alaska Airlines,9,S Kendall,10th October 2011,SEA-MIA. I had the misfortune of missing my flight the night before (my fault). I ended up flying out the next morning on my birthday my travel partner mentioned to the FAs that it was my birthday. They went out of their way and made me feel quite special. The FA asked me if I liked sweet or sour and soon came back with a special drink which he'd put dry ice in to make it bubbly! Then later they lent me a complimentary movie player. They were small gestures but really made my day. The service was great.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,D Dahlin,3rd October 2011,On return flight from Maui we sat in the first row behind 1st class. My wife needed to use the restroom and must use a crutch to walk so she went forward to 1st class. I went to the back but was blocked by 10 people in line who were blocked by the serving cart so I returned to the front. My wife had returned to her seat and another lady was going through the door so I waited. Then a lady attendant seeing me waiting told me I must go to the rear. I explained that the aisle was blocked by the serving cart she insisted I go back which I did. After the long wait on the serving cart I finally reached the restroom. When I returned to my seat the man in the aisle next to me asked why I went back. He said while I was gone 3 people had passed him and used the front bath room without any harassment. I realized that this restroom is intended for First Class but at the same time a little reasonable attitude and common sense by the attendant would be appreciated.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,Jerry Chen,10th September 2011,San Diego to Seattle return. The overall trip was excellent. The crew were nice and gave me a free extra snack. My carry-on was 2 inches larger than the maximum but the gate agent offered to consider it check-in luggage for no extra cost. Only negative point is that both landings were hard especially at San Diego.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,B Swanson,22nd August 2011,Burbank CA to Seattle WA. My mother is quite elderly staff were very courteous from the moment she exited the car. She was supplied with a wheelchair with and pushed by a staff member to both the ticket counter and security without waiting and then helped onto the plane. The trip went without a hitch.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,T Fitzpatrick,22nd August 2011,Flew nonstop Oakland to Kona. Its a much smaller plane than Hawaiian or United for example but seat size is the same. However there are no movies and music they will rent you small hand held pads. They only use one food cart in coach so if you are at the back you will wait over 1 hr after service starts. Food is reasonably priced. Staff are nice and helpful if you know what to expect its fine.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,K Castle,18th August 2011,The airline did got us to the destination however they re-assigned our seats upon check-in - to the lavatory row. I paid full fair for these tickets and spent 6.5 hrs with people standing next to us. When I asked to have my family back in their original seats I was told there was an equipment change. Apparently the computer runs the airline. The computer reassigned the seats and there is nothing a human can do to rectify the situation.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,8,F Tsang,17th August 2011,Bellingham to Las Vegas return. The flight was great and they provided us a free snack and drinks. Seats were comfortable crew are very friendly. Both flights were on-time. The only negative is that don't have enough check- in counters and staff at Bellingham it was a mess lining up.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,C Duckett,15th August 2011,MFR-PDX-LAS. Adequate flight to Portland with Horizon. Limited service and bumpy ride in crowded Bombardier. Great flight with Alaska in First after chaotic boarding at Portland. Pleasant cabin and comfy seat. Inflight service good drinks flowed freely though the meal wasn't to my taste.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,2,Stephen Spencer,11th August 2011,Puerto Vallarta from Los Angeles. Its only a 3 hr flight. We paid full price First Class not upgrades. First Class it was not. Besides the 737-400 being old and tired my seat was broken both ways. Seat pitch is the tightest I've ever experienced it was impossible to get up with the seat in front reclined. Food was awful there were zero amenities and pre-flight beverage service was water. I had to wait behind coach passengers to use the lavatory both ways despite the announcements alerting passengers about the usage of the front lavatory. The one bright spot was the use of their Board Room Lounge at LAX. Its very nice wonderful staff and plenty of amenities. Alaska needs to upgrade their First Class or go ahead and rip out the four abreast seats up front.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,no
Alaska Airlines,8,Frank Mauz,7th August 2011,"BLI-HNL on 737-800. ALOHA card on seat with ""Here's the Flight Plan"" on one side and ""Island Trivia"" on the other side sets the Hawaiian mood. Complimentary macadamia nuts and mai tai near arrival leaves a good impression. FA's efficient served free juices and cookie. Does not compare with international flights on Asian carriers but about as good as can be expected nowadays on a domestic flight.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,,John Seadler,30th July 2011,San Jose to Spokane Washington. Flight out of San Jose was delayed the agent assured me I would make my connecting flight. We landed and my connecting flight was on time I ran across the airport only to be told the plane had left already. There no apology for the delay or missed flight staff were surly at the gate. Instead of responding to my concerns with some empathy and trying to make a positive difference they went out of their way to make it worse. I've never had this kind of experience with Alaska in the past and I fly with them fairly regularly.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,no
Alaska Airlines,4,W Finck-McNeill,29th July 2011,"SEA to LAX. We were seated in first class row 1. When we tried to stow our carry on bags the crew had their stuff in our overhead. This forced us to use the overhead behind us which held those people's bags. Plus we got dirty looks from them. The same happened our return trip. We were appalled when coach customers lined up to use the 1st class restroom - why don't the attendants stop the coach from using the 1st restroom. When we pay for first class tickets we are paying for these ""Perks"" or so we thought. It is not our job to tell coach people the rules. It is Alaska Air's job to enforce them.",,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,no
Alaska Airlines,3,Michael Adams,29th July 2011,We flew to Maui from PDX return - flight over was great the flight back seemed to be on a different airline. The attendants were rude and had no desire to accommodate even a very simple request. Also we paid for our bags going both ways and were only supposed to pay going one way that was an extra 40 bucks. We could have just carried them on like so many others. We paid the 14 bucks for a digiplayer but the headphone quality was so bad we couldn't hear anything. We were finally watching a movie that was very old not a new release as advertised but with 15 minutes left in flight and 5 minutes of the movie they took it away. Overall the return flight was a very inattentive and miserable looking crew.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,,Bruce Epis,28th July 2011,San Jose to Kona First Class. The seats are not First Class standard. The food was awful and the crew were rude. Also our First Class bathroom always had a line as they opened it to coach class. Something I have never seen on any other domestic airline. There are no First Class lounges in San Jose or Kona.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,8,Andrew Smith,26th July 2011,LAX-YVR Economy. Boarding was a little chaotic and confusing as the announcements were not made clearly and sometimes hard to hear in the big departure hall at LAX. Staff seemed pretty laid back but were generally helpful. Nice to see an airline that still serves free snacks and drinks. 737-800 was in average condition with pretty basic interior decor.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,,N Strehlke,24th July 2011,I booked an Alaska flight for a short trip to San Jose CA from Los Angeles. I have never had an experience like the one I did on the return trip. 10 mins into the flight the cabin told us that due to a high volume of air traffic we would likely be delayed about 15-20 mins and would have to circle over LAX while waiting for a runway to open up. We end up circling over LAX for about 30 mins which wouldn't have been a big deal either except that we didn't land at LAX we landed at Long Beach about 30 mins away by car or 1hr 30mins with LA traffic). Then sat on the tarmac at Long Beach for nearly 2 hrs this is a 1 hr and 20 min flight to begin with and was given no information whatsoever about the airline's plans for us. When certain passengers were permitted to debark they were informed that they would be unable to retrieve their baggage from under the plane and would only be allowed to take their carryon out. Most of us had figured that the airline would probably shuttle us over to LAX. Word comes over the loudspeaker that we're flying back to LAX and will be there in about 1hr. I was expecting to meet an Alaska Airlines representative to explain to us that we would all get vouchers for cabs missed flights etc. no such luck. Not only did no one make an effort no one was even around. I couldn't find anyone from the airline other than the uninformed pilot and stewardesses. In the scheme of things delays like this happen and are sometimes unavoidable. What I don't get is how an airline can turn an hour and a half into 4 hrs by failing to plan ahead.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,10,T Gilmore,20th July 2011,SEA-YKM on Horizon (connecting to international flights in SEA) but I have been a customer for over 15 yrs. The interior of their planes is standard but their service is what puts them above other American carriers. Numerous times when flying out of YKM and connecting in Seattle to Continental Delta BA etc they have waived second bag fees. Ground staff gate staff and FA are all helpful and genuinely want to make your trip easier. On their longer domestic flights Alsaka still has the full service feel that was the norm in the early 90s. What really sets the apart is that twice now my flight to YKM has been cancelled or forced to return to Seattle due to freezing fog and both times I have been given a full refund without argument from the call centre staff. Highly recommended by a very loyal flyer.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,4,L Green,25th June 2011,Flew first class from Seattle-Chicago this week and was shocked at the poor cabin service. Cabin crew were ambivalent and made us feel unwelcome. The lunch offering - a bowl of soup a bread roll and salad - was very meagre. A very disappointing experience.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,8,H Monreal,23rd June 2011,In general Alaska Air has been my number one go to airline. They have been customer service oriented for as long as I can remember. The only bad experience I had was when I had MVP Gold status. I called the then Horizon MVP line and asked to have my husband seated next to me. They refused since he was not an MVP Gold. So I called the Alaska MVP Gold number and they put him next to me no questions asked. As for booking I recently booked a vacation through Alaska and had a difficult time. It would not pull in any of my account information from either my personal or EasyBiz account so I had to enter it all manually. Also unlike when you book just a flight you cannot pick your seats in their vacation page. I found both of these items to be frustrating. I doubt I will book a vacation through their site again. I will do everything separately.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,M Boron,13th June 2011,I was a little surprised to read the negative reviews of Alaska. I have always flown them and almost always satisfied and comfortable. Most recently I went Juneau to Kona and back with no complaints. I have found them better than other American carriers I have flown. Also of note due to flying in bad weather in Alaska most of their planes have cutting edge navigation technology in the cockpits.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,3,B Parker,4th June 2011,"Los Angeles-Vancouver on 737-400. Attempted check-in at kiosk but unless you have a US or Canadian passport you need to check-in at the counter. Staff neither rude nor friendly just robotic. Boarding a bit chaotic as passengers push aboard to hog overhead lockers with their gigantic carry-on bags. Was greeted at the door by a flight attendant's back. I said ""hello"" but no response. Proceeded through first class and waited patiently while passengers blocked the aisle stowing their carry-ons. I was happy to wait however a flight attendant shoves her hand in my face and shouts ""wait right there!"" I wasn't even moving! Walked past the first two rows of economy and noticed that they were smashed to pieces with a sign hanging that said ""do not use"". Not a good look. Airplane was totally full and the interior was showing it's age. Drinks and food for purchase served by frowning unenthusiastic cabin crew. Flight arrived on time baggage delivery fast. In the end they get you where you're going but like most North American based carriers staff are rude and unfriendly.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,1,K Worley,28th May 2011,We paid to fly First Class from Portland to Hawaii. Seats aren't much better than coach little leg room and hard seats. Inattentive flight attendants. No welcome drink prior to take off and the cabin was served drinks before we got ours. We used the call button and were told our FA was busy preparing our breakfast. Breakfast was fine. Digiplayer didn't have much of interest to offer. FA's disappeared after breakfast and were gabbing away. We rang again for another drink after about an hour and were ignored. Rang again and were berated for abusing the call button. Will never fly Alaska first class again stick with Hawaiian.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,3,J Stanton,22nd May 2011,"SEA-LIH-SEA. Flight out was OK. We were allowed to sit in our assigned seats. Hard to sleep because of numerous really loud announcements about buying food joining the frequent flier club signing up for a credit card renting a video player etc. Flight back was bad. When we checked in online the day before our return flight we discovered that Alaska had changed our seats from our nice aisle seats to poor ones. When we called we were told that it was too late to do anything; we should take care of it at the airport. That we had written confirmations of our seats which we had repeatedly reconfirmed meant nothing. At the airport check-in line we were told we had to go to the gate. At the gate we were told it was too late to do anything. The gate agent was apologetic but said ""it happens all the time."" Everyone we talked to basically said ""I don't know why this happened. We are very customer oriented. I can't help you."" Flight back was notable for the sleep robbing announcements to sell the same stuff. Does an airline have to wake everyone up to find out how many are flying on miles so they can sell more credit cards? Couldn't sleep much anyway; seat didn't recline.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,3,C Lou,15th May 2011,First class Seat 4D on Seattle/Chicago run was horrible coming and going. Like sitting on a concrete bench. Not acceptable for First or Business Class. Also what's with the Board Room restrictions? I suffered a 6-hour delay at O'Hare but American (partner in the lounge) would not let me use the lounge without a Board Room card. With a delay of any length they should give complimentary day passes to premium customers. On the plus side Alaska cabin crews are the nicest in the business and food is really good.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,1,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,G Erichsen,25th April 2011,BZN-SIT-BZN. Thanks to having a friend who works for the airline we were able to fly standby over an extended Easter weekend. We got everything we should have had we been paying the regular fare - planes were on time crews were friendly enough baggage was unloaded promptly the snacks were unappetizing the cabins were clean and seating was comfortable enough. We appreciated the efforts of the gate staff in Seattle to keep us informed of seating status on a full flight to Sitka (we were the last ones on the plane). The only complaint I have is a mild one and while not the airline's fault I mention it in hopes that maybe the airline will lobby a bit harder - the waiting area at the Sitka airport past security is cramped and without restrooms or any other amenities and the only food outlet at the airport was closed for the holiday.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,1,H McTyre,4th April 2011,"ANC-SEA-SFO-SEA-ANC First Class. Outbound uneventful and reasonably good service in First. Back was another story. Surly male flight attendant who was uninterested in serving in First Class. No service for the first 90 minutes of the flight. Service when it appeared was lackadaisical at best. No refills of drinks. Flight crew sat in jumpseats ignoring passengers (including me) who were trying to use restroom. Restroom appeared occupied for long period of time. Turned out the flight crew just couldn't be bothered to turn off the ""locked"" sign for about two hours of a three hour and 20 minute flight. I am looking forward to competition in the Alaska market arriving this summer.",,,First Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,,Debra Walen,4th April 2011,First class from Sea-tac to Maui and back. My friend did an upgrade for an additional 360$ to join me. Service was no smile food was so so the bathroom had a constant line from the back. I asked for a Mai Tai no! Everyone got a pre-mix at the end of the flight - we got about 10 nuts in a pack (same as coach) with that. I wanted a snack and was told the cheese and fruit plate was for coach only - lucky me they had extra and I purchased it for 7$. The only good things about this flight were the seat (large) and my bags were there. Be advised to bring your own pillow and blanket because Alaska won't give them to you - and my flight was freezing!,,,First Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,,George Whitehall,27th March 2011,"Had reservations for the family to go on spring break to California from Seattle. Not any more. Because of a computer failure all their flights were cancelled during the time period that my flight was to leave. Of course none of this was announced anywhere even on their website which I checked before we left for the airport. Got to the airport and walked into the ticketing area and huge lines of people everywhere all for Alaska Airlines. After two hours in line a customer service agent came by down the line and told everyone who had tickets for this morning that ""you might as well go home"". She said that all the other airlines were full that it would be 4 to 5 days before people could be rescheduled for their destinations. She did say that ""Alaska Air would waive their normal rescheduling fee"" That was it. No other explanation. If Alaska Airlines wants to pretend they are a big airline they need to quit treating their customers like dirt. What kind of company does not have a back up to their main operating system. The news said that they were updating their system. What company would run an update during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. Now I get to spend my time trying to get refunds from hotels cars and Disney Land.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,,Jo-Ann Leskun,24th March 2011,Going on a flight from Vancouver BC to Los Angeles on Alaskan/Delta air and found out that a checked on bag will cost about $25 each way (there are 4 of us $200 extra) but if I went to Mexico checked bag would be free. Alaska and Delta both stated that was because Mexico is an international destination but the US is not. Really? US Canada and Mexico are on the same continent but how can the airlines say that the US is not international travel from Canada or visa versa? We must depart from the international terminal we need a passport we have to go through customs we can buy duty free products.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,7,Nick Parry-Evans,24th March 2011,SEA-LAS. One of the very few direct flights to Las Vegas from Seattle so choice is very limited. I ask for very little on a short haul flight. There was a free soft drink and the usual packet of indescribable pretzels. Decent seat size and overall a clean aircraft. Landing at McCaron improves any flight as it is one of the best domestic airports I have ever been to. Functional though unspectacular.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,Peter Pomeranze,21st February 2011,Kona-Oakland First Class. A very comfortable flight despite the conditions at Kona International (no loungeno wifi etc). B737-800) is adequate for the 5 hour flight. Great flight attendants good food and drink fairly comfortable seat and decent entertainment via a Digiplayer.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,S Featherstone,21st February 2011,LAX-MEX-LAX January 2011. I had not flown on Alaska in quite a few years. This airline is in my opinion better than the average US carrier. B737-800 was clean newish and with pleasant staff warm snack. No baggage fee! Overall I would recommend Alaska Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,6,Paul Roos,15th February 2011,OGG-PDX-LAX and OGG-SEA return. We live on Maui and use both Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines to travel. This is a new market for Alaska and we hope they continue to improve their service. These flights were okay - standard mainland business class. Food was average. Service was good and attentive. What is lacking is a seat with better pitch foot rests and pillows or blankets. Hawaiian Airlines give you a seat with about 140 degree recline leg and foot rests and pillows and blankets. Both airlines are attentive to needs but Hawaiian has the edge with unsolicited water drinks etc. Costwise Alaska charges about $300 less than Hawaiian. For the money and the additional comfort I want Hawaiian is the better deal. But keep trying Alaska.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,10,K Benveniste,11th February 2011,First class from Atlanta to Seattle. The service was attentive and friendly. The meal on Alaska was beautifully presented flavorful and nourishing.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,3,B Lippert,26th January 2011,"Returned on Alaska Airlines from Kauai HI. We had barely left the ground and it was announced ""no fresh fruit"" - yesterday's only. Then midway through the flight we heard ""the system is out of water. There will be no more water to drink and please try not to use the toilets unless necessary - who goes into an airline bathroom unless it is necessary? I am only guessing but I think that if there was no time to get fresh fruit on board or enough water to last the flight perhaps the preventive maintenance wasn't done either. No apologies for lack of supplies and of course no coupon for future use.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,,H McTyre,18th January 2011,ANC-SEA-SFO-PDX-ANC. Most legs of this multiple leg round trip were relatively uneventful. The nickel and diming poor gate announcements surprise gate changes in SEA etc. have all become expected of Alaska Air. What is unacceptable is how unbelievably uncomfortable and filthy the cabins now are. Alaska has no excuse they're not short on cash. As for discomfort it is unacceptable to fail to pay close attention to climate control on a packed airplane. Usually you're freezing. PDX-ANC leg averaged about 84 degrees for the entire flight. Baggage claim continues to be a joke. Alaska claims to have a compensation program if your bags take more than 20 minutes to arrive. They must know nobody is going to stick around to make a claim for now-worthless Alaska Air frequent flier miles.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,5,E Mabley,18th January 2011,LAX-PDX roundtrip. Service on this trip was better than the last few times I've flown this airline - in other words it went from dreadful to mediocre. Flights were on time and the interior was comfortable enough but inflight service was perfunctory and cold. At least this time I was spared the flight delays dirty cabins mishandled baggage and pitiful customer service I've come to expect of Alaska Airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,Don Smith,17th January 2011,"STL-SEA-ANC December 24-25. Upgraded on a whim at check-in in STL. Took a little time for the agent to get it taken care of. Some slight delay due to de-icing. First Class STL-SEA pleasant crew in a holiday mood. Safety briefing done to ""The Night Before Christmas"" fun and got people's attention. Good meal and attentive service. Economy class SEA-ANC. Crew was not as jolly as previous flight and the cabin was full. Still good service. All luggage there when we arrived in ANC early Christmas morning.",,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,7,T Casey,16th January 2011,SFO-ANC. Economy class flight was fairly good. The crew was courteous and efficient. The cabin was clean. Flight was on time and checked bags came fairly quickly.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,7,Streb Lovell,6th January 2011,"LAX-MFR via Portland in first class. Both flights on time. Staff very professional. The ""light meal"" seemed rather skimpy since this flight took place around dinner time.",,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,G Cueto,27th December 2010,Very pleasant flight in Y-class from Newark to Seattle on Christmas eve. Online check-in to boarding were all a breeze. Clean plane leather seats and friendly and professional flight attendants that offered frequent beverage service. Two attendants in particular were warm friendly and professional and made the flight quite enjoyable.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,3,Ingrid Tobar,24th December 2010,Seattle to Kelowna BC and the boarding procedure was chaotic. They boarded three flights at the same time through a single gate. Upon arrival at the aircraft boarding zone there was no clear designation on which flight was which. As a result many passengers boarded the wrong aircraft and had to change planes shortly before departure. The same system applied to loading luggage which of course ended up being lost. At my destination I was told to expect a call from the central luggage department but this never happened. I called and got different versions on the status of my luggage: the first agent said it would be here on the afternoon flight the second agent said it had been scheduled but they were not sure whether it had arrived or not and the third yet most unprofessional representative Linda simply hung up when I asked her if anyone could guarantee that my luggage would be sent on a specific flight. It's sad to see such substandard logistics management for Alaska Air because the in-flight service was outstanding. Undoubtedly I will be sure to avoid this airline on my next trip to Canada.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,8,G Benson,1st December 2010,SEA-PHX in first class for the holidays. The first leg left an hour late due to the lavs not working. They brought around water and orange juice while waiting the hour on board. Breakfast served was pretty tasty. Return trip left on time drinks served quickly. Dinner also very tasty. Landed back in SEA early and checked luggage was very prompt. All in all Alaska air is improving their first class experience.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,8,V Cuevas,27th November 2010,Miami-Seattle. The inflight experience was great however it was a different story at the airport. Alaska Air is located in concourse E (or Central Terminal) at Miami Airport. The ticket counter area is small and a very inconvenient part of the airport. Unless you arrive very early for check in the line will stretch to where it will block the entrance to a food court behind the counter the exit path of Concourse E the entrance to a TSA check point and the exit of Customs located just below them. The flight departs from Concourse F and the upside to the airport is that there are only about a handful of flights departing from F that morning so TSA checkpoint a breeze. Boarding process was poor there were no pre boarding announcements and passengers just saw other's making the line to board and assumed it was time to board no matter what row they were in. The cabin crew was attentive and cheerful there was actually space in the overhead bins. The seats were comfortable however seat pitch was terrible! Alaska offers Gogo inflight internet and they rent DigEplayers which come with movies/games etc. The flight was 6 hours 24 mins - I had no idea a 737-800 had such a long range. The meals they served (or sold) onboard were fair at a reasonable price. We had the option for a hot or cold meal. Given the long length of the flight the crew did go around the cabin about 3 times for beverage service.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,9,C Dickson,18th November 2010,PDX-LAS B737 a pleasurable experience. After a 4 hour wait at PDX we were very relieved to get onto the aircraft. The aircraft was a little outdated but crew more than made up for it. Very attentive and professional. Overall very efficient.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,4,E Mabley,17th November 2010,LAX-BLI one way combination of Alaska and Horizon Air. This flight was better than my other experiences on Alaska/Horizon which isn't saying much. Nothing went wrong but the fare was higher than its competitor Allegiant Air and the onboard service and seating were poor. The unionised drone cabin crew couldn't care less about the customer. Horizon Air's DHC-8-400 props are noisy and uncomfortable. Allegiant Air despite their very inconvenient scheduling offers better service and better value for the money.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,9,R Tinker,27th October 2010,DFW-SEA-YVR. DFW-SEA sector in first class. Crew were very chirpy for early morning flight wih smiles all round and quick service. Seating ok for domestic First and digiplayers offered free of charge. SEA-YVR with Horizon air. Gate staff pleasant as were crew. 40 minutes after boarding crew were unable to close door and we were deplaned and sent back to terminal where we informed flight was cancelled. Ground Staff were excellent handling the situation and re- booked me on the next available flight with Air Canada. Bad situation made good by well trained friendly (even got a smile) and empathetic ground staff.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
Alaska Airlines,5,M Auerbach,17th September 2010,"Vancouver to Portland on Horizon (Alaska Air's partner for the short hops on puddle jumper planes in the Northwest) on a Q400. Check-in went well with assurances that the flight was on time. Then once aboard our plane we sat and we sat at the gate until the pilot informed us that there was a mechanical problem. The passengers were allowed to return to the gate and await the problem's resolution a two-hour delay on a one-hour flight. Although the crew thanked us for our ""incredible patience"" no compensation of any kind was offered! Upon arrival in Portland I sought out a gate agent requesting compensation. She helpfully offered me a $50 travel voucher or 2000 mileage plan credit. The moral of this story-always ask for compensation even if not offered up front.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,yes
Alaska Airlines,6,Roy Brown,15th August 2010,Due to booking a flight with Delta which sold the seats on Alaska beware. Alaska does not honour your original seats even though you resubmit and get confirmation of seat assignments. We had bought tickets for row 10 for my wife and I - Alaska decided to leave me in row 10 and at first had my wife in row 22 then row 28 after complaining the lady at the Kiosk put both of us in row 30 - the very rear. They do not seem to care much about customer relations. The flight was OK - on time etc.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,no
Alaska Airlines,10,George Nolta,28th July 2010,Coming back from Maui to Sacramento we were able to buy a 1st class upgrade for $100 each. It was a pleasure to have the improved room and service of first class. The counter staff at the Maui airport were extremely helpful and courteous. The food and service were great compared to traveling in coach. We feel we had a great value.,,,First Class,,,,,,,,4,yes
